04/15/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Using a debit or ATM card,,"Description from my complaint : On Monday, XXXX XXXX, I attempted to use my debit card and it was declined. Knowing there were funds available, I called the customer service number at Santander. I spoke to a woman who informed me that my card had been flagged for fraudulent activity and canceled/put on hold on Friday, XXXX XXXX. I never received a phone call telling me this. I tell her the charges on the card were not fraudulent, as I was traveling for work all week and weekend and had purchased the items. The woman then lifted the freeze on my card, and I was able to make an online purchase. 

A few hours later, I go to use my card again. It is declined. I call the bank back and am hung up on in the middle of speaking to someone twice. I call back a third time. The woman is so rude to me regarding the charges that I tell her I will go to my local branch. I walk to my local branch ( XXXX ), and the manager there informs me my card has this time been canceled, confirms a new one has been ordered, confirms my address and I leave. 

That was XXXX XXXX. Today is XXXX XXXX. After going to the bank numerous times and having the card sent to XXXX separate addresses, I have still not received a debit card. I have not had a debit card for my account for 43 days. 

I have already filled out a survey explaining all of this following my calls with the customer service center. No one ever called me. I have never been contacted regarding my issues, despite numerous phone calls and visits to my local branch. The service I have received, particularly being a new customer, is borderline unbelievable. 

At this time, I have gone on my online banking on my own and ordered a new card, and put in a THIRD address, hoping it would come there. To be very clear, both my home and the additional address I used ( work ) are extremely secure, so neither of these are instances of mail disappearing. They simply never arrived. 43 days later, I 'm ordering my own card, having never been contacted by customer service and still without a card, which I 'll spend another week waiting for, hoping it will arrive.

Also, this issue arose XX/XX/XXXX and Midland Funding issued the XXXX directly to IRS with NO copy to me or my Attorney. Is this legal? this is under-handed tactic and I only became aware of this as I was audited by the IRS XX/XX/XXXX for failing to declare this XXXXof XX/XX/XXXX, of which I had no knowledge.

03/24/2016,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I disputed this debt and on XXXX the agency removed it from my credit report. This company runs under many different names. I would get letter stating again, that I owe the debt. I would write back as required within 30 days stating I do not owe the debt, and requested proof that I owe it. I never received the proof, because I do not owe it. I sent the last letter out to their address and the letter was sent back to me, the letter was requesting proof that I owed the debt. Now, again, on XX/XX/XXXX, they are once again reporting it on my credit report. Mind you that this debt is from more than 5 years ago. They are reporting it as new, when it is not. In the state of Nebraska the statute states that the statute of limitation is 4 yeas, and mine falls under that category. I have explained to them I do not owe the debt, and the debt I had, I paid to the original creditor. Also, that I never lived at the address one of the services were provided. I am tired of this company reporting to my credit, and sending me letter from their sub companies in order to obtain money I do not owe. I have once again disputed with XXXX, and have decided to file this complaint. They have shady tactics to obtain money from a debt account they purchased. Originally it was with SW Credit Systems, I disputed it with them as well, then they "" sold '' my account to XXXX XXXX, Or XXXX, and its subcompanies. I need them to stop and not to "" sell '' this account to someone else so I can go through the same thing all over again.

07/01/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My house flooded out causing damages that are in excess of XXXX. I am insured with XXXX XXXX. The insurance company issued a check in the amount of a little over XXXX to both the mortgage company and me. At that time it was my understanding that my mortgage company was XXXX and it was when I called to notify them of the loss at which time I was told that XXXX would simply endorse the check back to me so I could get the rapairs made. Two hours later XXXX contacted me back and told me that my mortgage had been sold to Caliber Home Loans. I then called them and told them what had happened. I was told to send them the check and that they would then send another appraiser over to make sure that XXXX XXXX had figured enough for the damages. I told them that I had agreed to do the job for what XXXX XXXX was paying to which I was informed that Caliber does not let "" homeowner '' do their own repair and that it would take up to 5 weeks for them to have it appraised and get someone over to give a bid. I told them that I was a licensed contracter and I would make the repairs myself, at this time I was told that I would NOT be paid for any repairs made. I have made all the repairs with the exception of installing the carpet and the countertops. I have put out over XXXX total into my house at this time. Caliber has told me that I would have the total check sent to me and that if I sent a self addressed pre paid envelope for over night delivery that that I would have the check in 3-5 days. That was almost a month ago. I have been told this by numerous people yet at the same time everytime I talk to someone I get a different story. Last Thursday it was requested that I send them my receipts which I did. I was told I would get a check in 3-5 business days. TODAY I was told that a check for XXXX was sent out yesterday and that it would be up to 5 weeks before another one was sent. My house has no dining room, kitchen, master bedroom, dining room or master bathroom since XX/XX/XXXX and tomorrow is XXXX XXXX. This is totally unacceptable. My original paperwork from Caliber says that the only thing they will be doing is accepting the mortgage payments and all other parts of the mortgage agreement will remain in force. XXXX policy was to endorse the check back to the homeowner and let them get the job done either by themselves or a contractor of their choosing, THAT IS WHAT CALIBER IS SUPPOSE TO DO AS WELL, however they have point blank told me personally that they own my house and that I only pay rent on it. I asked them if they had contractors come give bids on my house and they bid morel than what XXXX XXXX 's quote was what would happen and they told me they would go to XXXX XXXX for more money, I then asked them if the bids came in less than what XXXX XXXX quoted, if I got the money back and I was told "" NO, that 's our money ''. They seem to forget that I have personal losses involved as well, I have property that was damaged. I have paid out for the water mitigation and drying out, yet I get no money for that whatsoever. I 'm going on 90 days of having to live like this and put my money out of my pocket on this job, that is not right. The majority of contractors get money "" up front '' before even starting the project and if I were a "" preferred '' contractor of XXXX they would have made a single copy check to me as a contractor instead of a dual check to the contractor AND the mortgage company. I am due my money, they have received a proper invoice yet they fail to pay anything more than XXXX % when the project is at approximately XXXX %.",,"Caliber Home Loans, Inc",AK,995XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/01/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1994977

My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I once had an account with Capital One. 
Sometime in XXXX XXXX, I purchased a subscription from XXXX for {$89.00} with a one week free trial. The site turned out to be very difficult to access, we have tried multiple times and gave up. Before that one week trial ended we wrote them an email cancelling the service, so we do not get charged the monthly fee of {$89.00}. When we got our statement the following month, we were still charged the {$89.00}, so we contacted Capital One and disputed the charges. We were asked to send in the documents that prove the cancellation. We have sent all the required documents by mail with return documentations about four, faxed it four times with confirmations of receipt on your end. Each time we get our statements, the {$89.00} keeps showing up as overdue, and in fact we have called Capital One many times, and each time we have to explain what happened and every time customer service pulls our file, there is nothing showing that we sent all the documents. This circle had gone on for more than 2 years since XXXX XXXX and after we gave up on contacting CapOne, we started getting harassing calls from CapOne/and or collectors on behalf of CapOne. Now the balance showing there has ballooned to more that {$330.00} and was reported as of course a negative one. 
Up to this day we are still getting the impact of that false report, have disputed it to the credit bureaus and nothing has been done. 
Now it is XX/XX/XXXX, and the false report and ballooned balance is in my report. This is not fair and we need to come up with a resolution to this matter. I can offer to pay the {$89.00} which is the original amount of that cancelled subscription, and in turn Capital One remove that false report on my credit. 
I appreciate an immediate action to this matter, not months or years.

06/10/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"My complaint concerns Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation 's ( NMAC ) inept handling of my automatic ( ACH ) payments for the payoff of my Nissan Rogue Select. I purchased my Rogue from a XXXX Ohio dealership in XXXX XXXX, and set up the simple interest loan amortization through NMAC. After my down payment and trade in, my loan balance was {$14000.00} with an interest rate of 3.27 %, and 4-year payment schedule of $ XXXX/mo. This was to be withdrawn from my checking account in monthly periodic payments until XXXX XXXX. 

Payments were periodic and monthly in the amount of {$310.00} from XXXX XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, when NMAC, for some reason stopped using ACH as the withdrawal mechanism. I was unaware of this, as I made NO change to my checking account to withhold payments. We love the car and certainly neither want a repossession of it nor a credit ding. 

Today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), I got a call from an NMAC account manager who expressed concern that my account was now in default and my credit score would suffer. This is came as quite a personal and disturbing shock, causing me to feel XXXX as to how to resolve this. I told the account manager that no action or inaction on my end deserved this kind of threat, credit downgrade, nor any other impending action despite the account manager being quite diplomatic and responsive. My bank had indicated to me that the drop of the ACH would have had to come from NMAC as they made no change to the account. This bothered me a bit all midmorning, including the possibility of a credit downgrade, and potential auto repossession. 

The account manager gave me a number and personal extension to call back to clear this up. Now, I had been making PRINCIPAL ONLY payments, since this year ( XXXX XXXX but for some reason NMAC was partially applying those payments to the "" soon-to-be delinquent '' account.

I then mailed them all my details including the pin I was provided when I freezed my credit account along with a check and credit card number tocover any fees. Yet they have not unfreezed my account. I am unable to buy a house because of very poor consumer treatment by Equifax. There is absolutely no way to unfreeze my account.

So it remains. I contacted the creditor, and found it to be a mortgage firm that foreclosed on my house, and STILL parked an account for the original balance and payments under a new company name. It 's listed as OPEN, with the last payment of XX/XX/2006. So, I am nowhere with my dispute, and my letters are being ignored. I have turned over my case to an attorney. There is never just one cockroach. If I go to my local public records, I expect to find more cases like mine. There was never any attempt to sue or collect, just that account that says OPEN.

I have mentioned that deposits that are made into my account were from sales of my personal assets overseas and sales receipts can be provided. 

I then received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America Enterprise Customer Care Resolution ) dated XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached Exhibit # XXXX BOA Letter ). 

I have replied back to XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX with supporting documents of sales receipts of my assets. Please see followings : Exhibit # XXXX BOA Respond ( Respond back to XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Exhibit # XXXX USPS Delivery Receipt ( USPS Delivery Tracking ) Exhibit # XXXX Household Items ( Sales of household items ) Exhibit # XXXX Car Sale XXXX XXXX ( Sale of Car A ) Exhibit # XXXX Car Sale XXXX XXXX ( Sale of Car B ) Exhibit # XXXX Call Log to Bank of AmericaMy respond to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America Enterprise Customer Care Resolution ) dated XX/XX/XXXX along with all supporting documents received by XXXX in XXXX, NC XXXX @ XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached Exhibit # XXXX USPS Delivery Receipt ). 

During the first telephone conversation I had with XXXX XXXX XXXX, I explained to her that I am a XXXX since the XX/XX/XXXX. My mother was XXXX and XXXX when I moved here in XXXX. She was in a XXXX hospital ( XXXX ) since the day I set foot into XXXX. Had my mother was not in that XXXX, I would 've taken a longer time to move into XXXX after selling my personal properties. 

My mother passed away in XX/XX/XXXX. I went back home in XX/XX/XXXX to close my chapter and sell XXXX cars and personal household items ( furniture & fixtures ). The money that got deposited into the account was proceeding of sales of XXXX cars and household items. 

I have tried calling XXXX XXXX XXXX at her office number XXXX XXXX Ext : XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I left voice mails on her number each time with my name, call back number and reference of the call. Please see the call log ( Exhibit # XXXX Call Log ). 

I have been an honorable man with a respectable credit history all my life. These are all my hard earned money which I need to survive here with my family in my new country. I am now facing financial hardships due to lack of useable funds. I urgently need my money back for my college bound son to admit in our college of choice. I am deeply puzzled with my current financial situation with BOA and need CFPB 's help to resolve this. 

I believe that I have been treated very poorly thus far and I am very disappointed with Bank of America. I have attached all the relevant documents for further review and hope to hear from CFPB and BOA as soon as possible to close this chapter. 

With sincere thanks in advance and looking forward for your response.

A resident, XXXX XXXX, came to see me regarding an issue he is having refinancing a home equity line he opened last year with Charter One/Citizens Bank. At the time of opening the line, the property XXXX XXXX owns at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX had no mortgage. XXXX XXXX obtained a home equity line for {$75000.00} based upon Citizens ' appraisal of his home which came in at {$94000.00}. This year, XXXX XXXX attempted to refinance this adjustable rate loan into a fixed rate mortgage, but was denied by XXXX based on their appraised value of {$44000.00}. We have opened a separate complaint against XXXX based on this appraisal, which we feel is low for the condition of the property, however, another concern has arisen during our analysis of comparable sales. It appears that the Citizens appraisal was over-inflated and not supported by area comps. This led to XXXX XXXX being granted a loan that he can not refinance into a fixed rate mortgage because he can not get an appraisal to justify it. One comp used in the Citizens appraisal was for a property outside of the city, and another was for a parcel with very different characteristics. A detailed analysis of our findings is attached.

The servicer has a trustee sale date scheduled for XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they are not legally bind to foreclose. 
Disputes : 1. I was approved by Keeping Home California / Hardest Hits Funds for the Principal Reduction Program that Select Portfolio participates in. The agency has sent several notices to Select and all have been ignored. I have stated this approval in all written documents to my servicer and all attempts to get an answer is ignored. 
2. I am repeatedly told by my servicer that the investor on my loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) will not approve loan modifications on the account. The servicer advised that the loan is owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I checked the trust and my loan is not shown in the list of loans and loan amounts. After further research, I find my home loan in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a completely different investor shown. I provide this proof to my servicer in written document and all attempts have been ignored. 
3. I have not been offered alternative programs to avoid foreclosure. 
4. Single point of contacts at the servicer has been changed practically every month. XXXX representatives on file, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have tried to talk me into allowing the servicer to foreclose on the property. My last phone conversation with XXXX XXXX resulted in her offering me a cash payout. 
5. The current mortgage loan is not the same loan before it was sold to my servicer. The servicer advised that the loan was modified but the modification was canceled by my previous servicer. Select Portfolio will not recognization nor assist with a resolution on this matter. 
The due diligence on my file has not been done and I am outraged that my numerous requests have not been correctly answered. I am seeking assistance from OCC to have the upcoming sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to be halted and an investigation done on my account. I received a Notice of Rescission of Declaration of Default and Election to Sell from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating that the loan is indeed questionable and wrongful foreclosure was attempted.

06/14/2016,Debt collection,Credit card,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"Lawyer/collection agency is trying to collect an alleged debt that I do not owe. I received a letter from another Law firm saying that they are collecting a debt for XXXX XXXX. An alleged debt that another law firm called Bowman, Heintz , Boscia & Vician were attempting to collect a few months ago. See case number XXXX of my previous complaint. Seems like the debt was sold to this new law firm called Blatt, Hasenmiller, Leibsker & Moore but this new firm or previous firm will not provide me any evidence that they purchased the debt from the previous law firm and they are now the new owners of this alleged debt. I asked for a copy of an agreement that has my signature and to validate the debt by showing a signed contract with my name that this alleged debt is mine. They have failed to provide me any evidence that they have the right to collect or that I even owe this debt. They provided me a copy of a judgment from the courts but anyone can get a copy of a judgment from public records. Having a copy of a judgement does n't mean that you own the debt and by just saying that the info has been validated does n't mean that it is true. This is all hearsay until we see some type of evidence that I truly owe this alleged debt. I have asked time and time again from the previous law firm and this current law firm to provide me with evidence that this alleged debt is mine. No one has produced a contract or an agreement with my name on it and they are just passing this info around to try to collect money from me. I do not owe XXXX XXXX anything, I do not owe this law firm anything. Not even sure how they come up with the amount they say I owe. I have never signed an agreement with XXXX XXXX and I do not have any contracts or an account with XXXX XXXX. The law firm is just a collection agency that is trying to collect free money. It seems thought that the first law firm gave up because they could not prove that I owe the alleged debt, so they past the case to another law firm which I found out the new firm is in the same building as the first law firm. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IN XXXX. What was their consideration of the payment? what proof they own the debt now? Was this assigned by XXXX XXXX, if so why did XXXX XXXX change lawyers when they already had someone trying to collect the alleged debt from me. This law firm is just another collection agency that is trying to get easy money by sending letters to consumers saying that they owe debt but ca n't proof any of it. This should be against the law. They should be able to provide something showing that the alleged debt belongs to whom. If I said that the alleged debt was paid in full, they would want some time of evidence that shows the debt was paid. I should have the same consideration. I ca n't just write that the alleged debt was paid, I would have to show it was by having a copy of the check, receipt or something in writing that it was paid. The agencies need to show something as well and stop sending letters trying to scare consumers to paying because they say we owe. Please view the letter that was sent to me as well as the letter that I sent for them to validate the debt or show any proof that I owe this debt attached to the complaint. Also see exhibits XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX attached, showing what is happening across this country with consumers and what FDCPA has been violated.",,"Blatt, Hasenmiller, Leibsker & Moore, LLC",IN,471XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/14/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1967758

06/16/2015,Credit card,,Late fee,,"This complaint refers to a specific recurring issue regarding the manner in which Capital One processes payments. My due date to pay my credit card bill is on the XXXX of the month with no grace period. However, payments actually made on the due date incur a significant late fee because Capital One says payments made that day are "" processed '' and then posted the next day. 

They claim a cut off of XXXX eastern time in terms of processing payments made that day. My contention, and I was told by the customer service person that this is a common complaint, is that if I make a payment on that date, whether it is early in the day or XXXX minute prior to XXXX, should be accounted for that day. Their policy, somehow written into the credit card agreement and no doubt buried somewhere in the mountain of fine print typical of cc agreements, is an absurd and egregious money grab. 

I asked that my credit card account and all billing issues be frozen until this matter was resolved and was refused. Also, credit card companies should be held accountable for these kinds of anti consumer practices. Some of us are smart enough to know that they have armies of lobbyists who allow them to get away with sticking it to us with crazy fees and penalties for the smallest mistake, but this is no mistake. If my due date is the XXXX and I pay on the XXXX, I should not be penalized regardless of their internal policy, accounting or cut off time. In fact, the cut off time should be moved to the XXXX to allow time for processing payments that were made on the XXXX.

07/09/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"Full detail provided in below attached PDF document. 
I accessed my free Experian credit report on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Prior to that date I had last looked at my credit report for refinancing my home a couple years prior. In the past XXXX years my credit report has reflected a FICO score of XXXX or higher, and is something I take very seriously and work hard to maintain. Thus when I saw that my credit report showed a past due account for which I was totally unaware, and which adversely impacted my FICO score, I inquired with Experian for detailed information on this past due account as I assume that it is incorrectly posted to muy account. I sent Experian a consumer inquiry via their webiste input screens as I assumed that the past due account was incorrectly posted to my account as I had never heard of the reporting company - XXXX XXXX XXXX . However, after XXXX days Experian reported via their website that regarding my inquiry, the "" outcome remained the same '', which appeared to be a canned consumer response. I question seriously if anything was done at all, as I would expect XXXX to contact me regarding my inquiry so that we could rectify this incorrect posting. 
I then wrote a letter, attached below, and mailed it to both Experian and to XXXX regarding this past due account and in this letter notified them that I would wait XXXX days for them to respond and would then come to the CFPB consumer complaint portal to file a complaint. Today I placed XXXX more electronic complaint on the Experian website, where I attached the below letter. I have been unable to contact XXXX or to receive any communication what so ever from XXXX regarding this complaint. 
My main reason for this consumer complaint is to protest that XXXX is allowed to provide a past due notificaiton to my credit report without ever having made any contact with me what so ever. I have never had any communications with this Progressive company, have never spoken to anyone from this company, have never received anythign in the mail from this company, and when I inquired about this company to Experian, I have recieved XXXX information to allow me to investigate either this company of this past due account. 
Thus the reasons for my consumer complaint are, 1. ) I wonder how many other consumer accounts are being incorrectly reported by XXXX with XXXX consumer communications prior to these postings, and 2. ) I wonder if Experian has any guidelines for reporting companies or requirements that reporting companies show proof of consumer correspondence for such harmful postings. 

As in many cases, communications is the most important issue here and most consumers probably do not know about the CFPB consumer complaint portal, and are not as persistent as I have been. I am amazed that Progressive has received XXXX inquiry regarding my account from Experian and a XXXX inquiry from me and still I have recieved XXXX communications at all from this company which I have never heard of. I would believe that companies such as XXXX who are allowed to post derogatory credit reporting information against consumer accounts would be required to meet consumer contact requirements prior to making such harmful postings. The assistance of the CFPB in this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
P.S. Please note that I have selected above that this past due credit reporting comment is not mine, and while I certaily believe this to be the case, my complaint is that I can not receive any background response what-so-ever into this issue to prove if it is or ever was a valid account or who it really does belong to.

I requested some kind of proof to show me what the bill is and they refused. They told me that "" they will only send proof to an attorney so I better get an attorney ''. I ca n't afford an attorney for a debt I font even remember or know is mine. I requested proof several times and told them I dispute this debt until proof of the debt is supplied. 

XXXX who is the collector said that I am an irresponsible person and I should be checking my credit once a year. I pulled my credit and could not find this debt.

My account was paid ON TIME OR EARLY everymonth, NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT or NEVER PAID LATE. During the entire time I hadthis account my credit was poor and now is much better than anytime in the past5 years.

Synchrony bank periodically reviews accounts based on its existing creditpolicies and standards and information provided by credit reporting agencies aspermitted by the fair credit reporting act. This decision is final and willappear as credit line closed by credit grantor. The reasons are based on yourentire credit history and not just solely your history with synchrony bank -principal reasons for making this decision- Serious delinquency and publicrecord or collection filed, too few accounts currently paid as agreed, numberof accounts with delinquency, proportion of balance to credit limits onaccounts to high. My credit WAS WORSE THE PAST 5 years than it is now. Theycould have closed my account, based on those reasons, when I HAD AN ACCOUNTBALANCE, but WAITED until the ACCOUNT WAS PAID IN FULL to do this.

My credit is better now than at ANYTIME that I had the care creditaccount open, yet they chose NOW to review my derogatory credit and close theaccount. It 's because it was paid off.

For many years I banked with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I would have double charges on my account by many merchants ( I believe it was the merchants that XXXX XXXX XXXX worked with or furnished access devices to ). I could not stop the double charges. The unauthorized charges then would lead to large fees and overdraft payments that were not correct to begin with. 

I decided to change bank accounts many times and the double charges by merchants followed me. The double charges were different depending on the bank. Banks and Merchants work together. Banks are required to furnish access devices to the merchants. I would see double charges with merchants that the bank would the banks furnished access devices or electronic payment devices to. For example XXXX XXXX XXXX furnishes electronic access payment device to its merchant XXXX, and I would see double charges on my XXXX XXXX XXXX account with merchants that XXXX furnishes the device to. 

When I would switch bank double charges would show up with new merchants, usually the merchants affiliated with the corresponding bank. I believe the bank then changes the statements to make it look like the customer used there pin with the card. 

I want to be paid back in full, plus interest, I want the bank and merchant to be FINED. I want to collect a portion of this. This banking FRAUD, DOUBLE charges, Excess fees, unauthorized transactions have destroyed my life. I have lost everything for looking into this. 

I have contacted endless government agencies including local and federal policing agencies. I have tried to hire an attorney to fight against these banks. As soon as I get organized and get my statements together, I get stuck. I moved out of my home XX/XX/2012 and moved into hotels thinking the banking nightmare would stop. It continued and got worse. The hotels then double charged me. I would fight with the hotels asking for charges to be reversed. I would call the bank and neither the bank nor the merchant would return the money or fees involved. 

Here is the letter with a snap shot of what has been going on. I am waiting on new statements from all banks to send to your agency. I have been contacting every other agency without understanding who to contact. 

This letter is to Checks Systems with a snap shot of the banking nightmare. The letter also includes all the government agencies that I have contacted.

02/03/2016,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"While shopping in Macy 's in XXXX XXXX I was persuaded by a customer service rep to open a joint account for my daughter. The rep informed me that after my daughter had received the card she would be able to contact Macy 's and have my name removed from the card. The card was approved and I never received a credit card or statement because all of this was sent directly to my daughter 's address. Approximately six months later I received a call from Macy 's in reference to a late payment. I informed them that I was under the impression that the card was not still in my name a I had never seen a card or a statement. I was informed that the card was in my name. I then informed the representative that I wanted the card closed. I was informed that I could not close the card because it was a joint statement. I then stated that I wanted the card usage to be suspended until the balance was paid off. I was told that they could not do that either. I asked for the bills to at least be sent to my home so that I could monitor the payments. It took 3 calls to Macy 's to receive the bill. When I saw the bill I was surprised to see that they had my name incorrect with the wrong middle initial. XX/XX/XXXX my daughter initiated Chapter XXXX proceedings. Her attorney 's office informed her that she could file Macy 's under her Chapter XXXX. She later informed me of this. From that point I no longer received any statements from Macy 's. I received no correspondence from Macy 's including a statement or late notices. I was under the impression that the attorney had given her correct information. I received a letter in the mail from Macy 's XX/XX/XXXX informing me that they had been trying to reach me by phone and wanted to verify my information. I in turn called Macy 's to see why they were trying to contact me. They informed me of the credit card charges. I informed them that the account was under a bankruptcy. They then claimed that they had no information under my daughter 's name or her social security number. They were holding me responsible. I talked to a Citibank representative and we were not able to resolve anything as she was trying to twist my words and she gave me the wrong name for my daughter. On XX/XX/XXXX I was able to speak to a representative named XXXX and explained to her what my complaints. I first asked her for the account number as I have no record of the account number and she told me that they were unable to give account numbers over the phone. But ... she wanted me to make a payment over the phone. I explained to her that I was not willing to make a payment over the phone to an account number that I did not know and that I would certainly bring the account up to date when I received the statement in the mail. She said that she was generating a bill and that I would receive in seven to ten business days. Why so long I do n't know. I have received three other calls since then from Macy 's and Citibank about the account. I have explained that I am waiting on the bill. I have been told that they they see in the computer where XXXX generated the bill and that they could not generate another. I asked could they expedite it and was told no. Incidentally I have worked for the postal service for over 25 years and it is rare that it takes more than fourteen days to deliver a first class letter. My main complaint about Macy 's and Citibank is that I believe that they are purposely delaying the delivery of this statement to accrue as much interest and tack on as many extra charges as possible. The majority information that they supposedly mainly pertains to my daughter such as e-mail address and they have her address included on my credit report. This is adversely affecting my credit status and I believe could have been avoided if Macy 's had chosen to send a bill to my home as requested.

I contacted Loan Depot to inquire about this on XXXX/XXXX/15 and was informed that the property tax payment was being held XXXX for XXXX weeks by before being paid to the XXXX XXXX Tax Assessor 's office prior to the due date at the end of the month. I requested that this payment be stopped by LoanDepot and XXXX due to the fact that it was already paid by the buyer, however, I was told by the LoanDepot CSR XXXX customer service representative ) that they were unable to do this and I would have to wait for the payment to be paid by XXXX, then refunded by XXXX XXXX to XXXX, then refunded to me from Loan Depot. I was told that this process XXXX take up to XXXX weeks due to the time it may take for XXXX XXXX to send back refund. I escalated to a supervisor at LoanDepot at this time, who then contacted their tax department and was told that there was nothing more that could be done. 
Over the next XXXX weeks, I followed up with the XXXX XXXX Tax Assessors office to confirm that they received the duplicate tax payment of {$4400.00} and verified that they had mailed the refund back to XXXXLoanDepot on XXXX/XXXX/15. During the week of XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted LoanDepot customer service to verify receipt and request a date in which they would send me my refund of {$4400.00}. I was told by multiple customer service representatives at LoanDepot that once the check was received by XXXX, it would be processed immediately and LoanDepot would send a check out within 7-10 business days from the date of receipt. On my follow up calls to LoanDepot during the week of XXXX/XXXX/15, I was told that they had received the refund from XXXX XXXX as of XXXX/XXXX/15 and I should be receiving my refund check within XXXX business days from that date, which would be between XXXX and XXXX. 
On the afternoon of XXXX/XXXX/15, after I had n't received the refund in my mail, I contacted Loan Depot and was told by the CSR that the notes on the account from XXXX stated that my refund check was being sent via overnight delivery, however, tracking information would take XXXX hours to show up in the account. On the afternoon of XXXX/XXXX/15, after I still had not received my refund check in my mail, I contacted LoanDepot again, and was told again that that my refund check was being sent via overnight delivery ( as of XXXX/XXXX/15 ), however, tracking information was still not notated on the account. She then stated that I should definitely be receiving the check by XXXX/XXXX/15. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted LoanDepot again after I still had not received my refund with the day 's incoming mail. I was told that they would escalate to the tax department to obtain status and tracking number. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted LoanDepot again and spoke to a CSR Supervisor named XXXX XXXX. XXXX was very helpful by taking full ownership to determine accurate status of my refund.

I received the cards then my daughter comes to me shortly thereafter and said that her credit score dropped almost XXXX points due to this Chase credit card. I was not sure how this could happen, as they did not have her permission, nor her social security number. I called Chase. They were not helpful and just said that it 's part of their process and it 's on their website that any other user 's information will be used. So I went back to the website and printed off the documentation - and did NOT find such info. Chase also put me through to the credit bureau they use ( I do n't recall which but seems maybe like XXXX ). I asked how they obtained my daughter 's permission and SS number to run her credit. They proceeded to tell me that they matched her name with my address and located her information in their database. Needless to say, this appears to be a privacy issue, at the very least. My daughter is trying to buy a home in the next year, and this does not help her FICO score! With Chase nor the credit bureau willing to help, I feel my only option is to file this complaint with your agency. This is a privacy issue and I can not fathom how Chase would legally be able to run her credit - without my daughter 's permission.

02/05/2016,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"I am having a problem settling my Banana Republic XXXX Card due to some sketchy circumstances outlined below. The whole issue is somewhat complicated ; I will try to explain it at succinctly and clearly as possible. 

I am hard of hearing and do not want to handle the settling of the account in question over the phone. I wish to settle the account because I can no longer manage the payments : I have not put any additional charges on the card since XXXX 2015, and aggressively tried to pay off as much as I could, but I have missed payments and have been unable to meet my minimum payment for the past few months. Now I am at the point where I am unable to make any payments without foregoing other, more important needs, and interest keeps rising while my credit keeps falling. I have been attempting to settle the matter in writing for over six months now and have become very frustrated in my attempts. 

On my first couple attempts at settlement I received one letter stating they agree to only communicate in writing and another stating I MUST call and speak to a representative if I want to see if I qualify for any of their hardship programs. Another time they told me to call the XXXX ( which I do not have, nor do I wish to communicate that way : written communication is my preferred method in these matters ). At one point I was directed to a different address than the one I originally found : an Ohio address versus a Florida address, but when I wrote them about the issue they responded saying they needed a power of attorney in order to talk to someone other than me ( which I never asked for ). And the response came from the original Florida address, interestingly. In response to my most recent attempt sent to the Ohio address, which highlighted all of the ongoing issues, I once again received the letter agreeing to only communicate with me in writing and the other stating I MUST call to discuss their hardship programs. This response also came from the Florida address and not the Ohio one I sent the information to. 

Notwithstanding the fact that requiring me to speak with a representative to determine eligibility seems to be a blatant violation of the ADA, I believe that regardless of my XXXX I should be able to handle this matter in writing. Especially since upon researching this matter many suggested I get the deal in writing because of issues they have had with this company after making deals over the phone. I contacted the Attorney General 's office in my state, and they suggested make this complaint to help resolve this issue.

We were asked to submit documents multiple times for the refinance and sometimes the 'online portal ' was not working correctly, so we were encouraged to 'just email ' it to our team of refinance people ( XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX , and the underwriter ). As we all know, email is notoriously unsafe for the transmittal of sensitive documents. Prior to my husband and I completely pulling out of the refinance process due to Wells Fargo 's inability to complete the simple paperwork, I came across an email that showed that our home appraisal was SHARED with a couple in XXXX by the name of 'Powers ' which closely resembles our name 'Bowers ' , but only if you can not read. We came to find out that personal information was not only transmitted over email, but shared with complete strangers who 's name happened to sound the same as ours. We have since opened up another refinance with our local bank ( XXXX ) and the process is going smoothly. I have requested our appraisal fee to be refunded, but so far Wells Fargo REFUSES to give us back that lost {$350.00}. We had to come out of pocket for another appraisal with our new application with XXXX.

04/07/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"We bought our first house and closed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We used a Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX, from Prospect Mortgage to do our loan for us. We had been in contact with this loan officer in XXXX but had put our home search on hold. A realtor friend had highly recommended her when we had started looking for a house a couple years ago. She had taught a first time homebuyers class and we were so impressed in her ability and willingness to explain and teach us that we sought her out again XX/XX/XXXX to work with her. In the beginning of our search she was great - always answering the phone, returning emails, after we lost out on a couple offers she became very difficult time getting a hold of and barely followed up on email or was willing to explain anything to us. We finally got an offer accepted and hoped it would get better rather than worse ... but it got worse. We had a very difficult time closing and had to keep filing for extensions because of the lender 's side but never really got much explanation. We were jerked around by Prospect and were left in the dark. We just found out that they never filed for our Mortgage Credit Certificate ( A program through Washington State Housing Finance Commission ) - which would have allowed us to save a lot through a tax credit ( XXXX ). The MCC application is supposed to be submitted by the Lender. We notarized the application and returned it to the Lender but it never got filed. Our biggest regret was not changing loan officers and companies once we started getting a bad feeling. But this was our first house and we did n't want to XXXX so we did everything we were told. We thought it was all behind us since we closed XX/XX/XXXX but now with taxes we wanted to follow up on the MCC since we had not received the certificate which we thought would come during tax document season. The lender 's response was to follow up with the state because she knew for sure she had filed everything and when I talked to the state they said it did n't look like they had a MCC application from us ( which we had sent to the loan officer twice which meant we had to have it notarized twice! Attached is a copy of the MCC application dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and a screenshot of the email in which the document was provided to the loan officer ) but would follow up with our loan officer to see where things went wrong. The next day XXXX emailed and said "" Thank you for reaching out to them for clarification. I did hear from them and happy you got better clarification that I had received. I am forwarding this to my operations manager and area manager to figure out what to do and what happened. I wanted to make sure that I emailed you right away that I am working on it. '' And I responded that we had n't heard back and were still in the dark. She did n't respond so a week later I emailed her again and said that we have not heard from her or the state and she finally confessed that it was on them that they did n't turn in our certificate application. Our realtor that we worked with spoke very highly of her in the beginning and as time went on we could tell he was also confused by the lack of communication and frustrating extensions.

07/29/2015,Credit card,,Late fee,,"My credit card issuer, Citi Cards, has charged late fees and interest on a disputed item that Citi Cards itself later agreed was invalid. Although Citi Cards reversed the disputed charge, it refused to reverse the late fee charge and interest for nonpayment of the disputed charge. I paid all charges to my account, except one item I had previously disputed, and requested cancelation of the card. Citi Cards charged me a late fee and interest solely on the pending, disputed charge, and then in the same month agreed that my dispute was correct and reversed the charge but not the late fee and interest. 
Despite letters and phone calls, Citi Cards continues to add monthly late fee and interest for nonpayment of the initial late fee that never should have been charged. 
On one call XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, however, Citi Cards representative agreed that the interest and late fee charges were solely on the reversed charge ; that the interest and fee charges were incorrect ; that the charges would be reversed in "" XXXX days '' ; and that the account would be closed with XXXX balance due. Both my husband ( XXXX retired XXXX ) and I were on speaker phone and heard the representatives statements. None of promised actions were performed by Citi Cards. 
In all subsequent conversations and letters, Citi Cards has simply repeated "" a late fee is assessed when your minimum payment is not received by the due date. '' Apparently Citi Cards takes the position that, as a matter of its policy, it does n't matter if the amount due or minimum payment is actually not due. 
Citi Cards has falsely reported the status of the account to credit reporting agencies. As of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX report on the account stated, "" Account closed at consumer 's request and disputed investigation completed. Consumer disagrees. XXXX days past due as of XX/XX/XXXX. '' Citi Cards has failed to report on XX/XX/XXXX, it agreed that the disputed charge had been reversed. 
To substantiate my complaint I have included these documents : -Citi Cards XXXX Statement XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, shows purchases of {$240.00} and an additional charge of {$95.00} for renewal of the card. Page 2 shows that the disputed seller XXXX had dropped XXXX of the disputed charge of {$190.00} or {$95.00} ; and that Citi Cards had extended "" conditional credit for dispute '' of the other half or {$95.00}. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX shows payment of {$290.00}, which fully covered the purchases on previous statement of {$240.00} and the new purchases on this statement XXXX p 2 XXXX of {$55.00}. The subsequent statements show that there were no additional purchases on the account. Also on p.2 it states it determined dispute to be "" a valid charge. '' The was the only notice I received from Citi Cards that the disputed charge was upheld. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. The first charge of a late fee. Since at that time all purchases had been paid and the annual fee refunded, the late fee was for non-payment of the disputed {$99.00} that was reversed the previous month. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards reversed its previous reversal and provided a credit for the disputed {$99.00}. It did not reverse the previous month 's late fee for nonpayment of the disputed {$99.00}. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Another late fee for nonpayment of the previous late fee for nonpayment of the disputed {$99.00}. Total now {$53.00}. 
-Citi Card letter of XX/XX/XXXX. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Another late fee. Total now {$89.00}. 
-Citi Card letter of XX/XX/XXXX 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Another {$35.00} late fee. Total now {$120.00}. 
-My letter to Citi Cards of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, explaining that the late fees and interest charges are solely for nonpayment of an amount that was not due.

FCRA and FDCPA laws were enacted to protect consumers from specifically these type of actions by creditors, specially when it affects disproportionately a double minority group as in my case a single parent ( XXXX ). I stand to loose the credit cards and financial considerations I have received over this last 2 years from other creditors due to my improving financial credit record by the negligent and unprofessional actions effected by Nationstar Mortgage I expect immediate correction of my credit bureaus reports. Apology and retraction letter by Nationstar Mortgage and the payment of all FDCPA and FCRA violations fines which should credited to my principal mortgage balance for damages and penalties payable to me as a consumer.

08/24/2015,Credit card,,APR or interest rate,,"I took out a XXXX interest credit card through Wells Fargo to purchase an engagement ring for my fiance in XXXX. I paid off the ring and had a zero balance as of XXXX XXXX. I also purchased our wedding bands with this Wells Fargo credit card in XXXX XXXX. I never once missed a payment and over paid the minimum payment every time. As of XXXX XXXX my balance was {$630.00} when I received a bill of {$1300.00}, with a charge of {$720.00} in interest charges. I immediately tried to contact Wells Fargo and when I called the XXXX time was placed on hold for over an hour and then transferred to a woman who would not help me. I tried to call back XXXX more times to get in touch with someone who could help me to sort this out. Finally I went to the Wells Fargo branch on XXXX in XXXX, PA and I was told they have nothing to do with credit card services. The next day I went into the Wells Fargo branch on XXXX and XXXX and again no one could help. I tried to explain both over the phone and in person I could and would pay the balance of {$630.00} off immediately. I had no idea they could or would be able to charge me more in interest than my remaining balance on the credit card. I never received a notice that I was going to be charged interest, if I had been notified I would have immediately paid the balance. After numerous attempts to contact Wells Fargo with no success I had no choice but remit total payment of {$1300.00} ( cc remaining balance - {$630.00} + interest- {$720.00} ). I still can not believe a credit card company could charge more in interest than your balance and not notify you that you are going to be charged. If I had known I would have paid the remaining balance off immediately. It was very frustrating that I could not contact anyone at Wells Fargo to dispute these charges. Again I never missed a payment and overpaid every month. I think Wells Fargo has taken advantage of me and forced me into a {$720.00} interest payment without warning me this was a possibility or that the XXXX interest terms would be ending.

05/04/2016,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"XXXX is attempting to collect a debt from me against their own customer agreement, changed a policy outlined on its website to defeat my complaint, and disregarded the first assigned debt collector who wrote me an apology letter, evidently believing XXXX violated debt collection laws. 

I transferred mobile carriers from XXXX to XXXX on the last day of my billing cycle. I shortly thereafter called to confirm my balance was XXXX dollars. 

My account was later debited about {$400.00}, and so I called for a refund, but was informed that I was no longer the account owner and needed permission from one of the remaining lines, my mom. The representative three-way called my mom, who asked XXXX to refund me. I received a refund a few days later. 

About two months later I received a bill for over {$1000.00}, but when I called to dispute the bill, I was told I was the account owner, and moreover that I did not transfer liability pursuant to an "" assumption of liability '' policy outlined on XXXX website, which I disputed as inapplicable, and because it contradicted prior representations. XXXX then changed the page in an apparent move to defeat my complaint. 

My mom states that XXXX told her she could not leave the carrier until the following billing cycle and that she would not be charged. From the billing statement I received, there was no usage on her line, but she was still charged. 

The debt was sent to a collection agency, but after I wrote them a letter, they apologized and said they would cease their collection efforts, and would forward our correspondence to XXXX. The debt was then assigned to a second collector, although an executive representative from XXXX said they did not receive anything from the first collector. 

My credit score, which was formerly "" very good, '' was also impacted XXXX points.

I am trying to refinance this same exact home with NYCB that has been financed with NYCB for the past 3.5 years, to get a lower interest rate, from 4.375 to 4.0. Absolutely nothing has changed in the home since NYCB readily and easily financed this home 3.5 years ago, without any questions or reservations whatsoever. 
Currently, they refuse to refinance the same exact home, as they say this is a multiple dwelling home. I rent the home to XXXX person. She apparently has a XXXX of roommates. I do not have any problem with her having roommates, as I have nothing to do with them. I only have a rental agreement with my tenant, and receive rent from said tenant, that has lived there for 2 years. If she has a couple of roommates that help her pay the rent, that is usual and customary, and quite the norm in XXXX, where rent are high. 
According to the XXXX city code, to be considered an accessory dwelling, another stove must be present. There is XXXX, and only XXXX stove at XXXX XXXX XXXX. In the absence of said stove, the XXXX areas of the home in question can be considered wet bars, recreational rooms, bedrooms, etc. However, they are not accessory units. According to the city code, an accessory unit is defined as follows : What is an ADU? 
An ADU is a complete independent residential living space that can be created within, attached to or detached from a single-family home. An ADU include provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. An ADU can provide supplementary housing that can be integrated into existing single-family neighborhoods to provide a typically lower priced housing alternative. 
XXXX XXXX of these XXXX areas of the home that NYCB is calling "" accessory units '' have cooking facilities. 
NYCB did the exact same thing almost 2 years ago to the date with the home that I live in.. After months of wrangling, heartache, and many pounds of flesh, it was kicked to XXXX XXXX , the XXXX vice president of underwriting, who realized immediately NYCBs absurd argument, and funding happened shortly afterward. Perhaps NYCB also realized I would not give up. I do n't know exactly, but do know interests rates have gone up since I locked in at my present rate of 4.0. Perhaps this has something to do with it. 
Please finance the loan, and let 's not repeat the fiasco of 2 years ago. I am a great customer and have never, ever missed a payment, although I am getting weary of NYCB 's way of doing business.

12/09/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't get flexible payment options,"University XXXX XXXX - Private student loan with National Collegiate TrustI 'm a mother of XXXX boys, and at this time, my boys were very little so being able to leave my home to go to class was impossible. I saw the University XXXX ( XXXX ) commercial and decided to call. The counselor I spoke to was nice ... suckered me right in! He told me that my husband and I did not make enough money and I would need to take out a private student loan on top of the grant and financial aid just to pay for school. The counselor even showed me where to go online to find lenders. National Collegiate Trust was the lender, I was the low income naive person perfect enough to take out the loan ... .but to make matters worse, I drug my now ex-husband down with me ... he co-signed. I did n't have enough credit to borrow money, but together with my ( at the time ) husband, we could borrow. I wound up taking out XXXX loans - both together total {$30000.00}. I wish I had thought about it then, I would have done things totally different. For one, I would NEVER attend XXXX, they are liars and my credits would n't even transfer! For two, I would have NEVER taken out any private student loans! They do NOT follow federal guidelines! 
Moving forward .... 
A man came to my employer and served a coworker. I was being garnished by XXXX ( Collection agency for National Collegiate ). I did n't even know I had been sued?? So I file a claim for exemption because now I am a single mom raising XXXX boys with XXXX small income. I agree to allow a garnish of {$50.00} per week. Then a horrible event takes place ... .I get laid off. I file unemployment and wait the agonizing time it takes to actually receive an unemployment deposit. While waiting for the first deposit, I call XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX to see if they will continue to accept my {$50.00} a week from my personal account, and of course, they will not. They have already started to garnish my ex-husband {$800.00} a week! He is lower income and helps to support his daughter and our XXXX grandbabies. I have to add that this all took place one month from XXXX. I went to the courthouse and filed a claim for exemption for him. I will update on the status of that hearing set for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 
I have been researching and from what I have read, you have to be served to be sued! I was never issued a summons in the first place, and neither was my ex-husband. Also, if private student loans are to be treated as federal loans, then why are they allowed to garnish 25 % instead of the max federal can garnish which is 15 %? National Collegiate wants me to pay back {$30000.00} in 7 years! I thought student loans were 30 years? Also, and this part is important ... ..why would n't my private student loans go into deferment if they follow federal guidelines? Lastly, If private student loans are not discharged in bankruptcy, they why do they have to get a judgement before they can garnish ; whereas, federal student loans do not have to seek judgement. Sounds like private student loans should be considered credit cards or regular loans to me. I will never be able to pay back {$30000.00} in 7 years and neither will my ex-husband. If we could do that, we would be driving around in really nice vehicles! My vehicle is a XX/XX/XXXX, I live in an all-bills-paid apartment complex in a lower income neighborhood. Please help me in any way you can! If they continue to garnish my ex-husband, that only takes away from our individual family needs! How will we live?

09/14/2016,Credit card,,Late fee,,"For about 50 years, I had a credit card with Macy 's. For the past 20 years, at least, I rarely used it. Occasionally, there would be a discount available on a purchase with the use of the card, and I would use it then. Since I used it so rarely, I usually had to update the account with the cashier at the time of purchase. Each time, I continued to have the same card, same number, and same name on it. In XX/XX/2016 I made a purchase, using my Macy 's card, was told I had to update it, and did. This update was a bit more complicated, and I was issued a new card with a new number and in a variation of my name - from XXXX ( husband 's name ) to my name. I received the bill for that purchase, which was due in mid XXXX and paid it on time. 
In XXXX I made another purchase at Macy 's in the amount of {$48.00} on my credit card and did n't receive a XXXX statement. I did n't realize that I did n't receive a statement because I was unused to looking for Macy 's bills. I will mention here that for at least 40 years I have used my other credit cards extensively each month and pay them on time and in full. Besides being old ( XXXX ) I 'm old fashioned that way! 
In late XXXX I received a phone call from Macy 's saying that my XXXX bill had n't been paid. I explained that I had n't received a bill and was told that I owed {$75.00}. I was surprised and believed that if I could speak with a superior, I could explain the error. After asking repeatedly for someone who could help me rather than someone who was trained to parrot over and over, "" That 's our policy, '' I said that when I received a bill, I would pay it since I did n't know the exact amount of my purchase, but that I would n't pay a fee. 
In XXXX I received a Macy 's bill for {$75.00} - my purchase of {$48.00} plus a fee of {$29.00}. I immediately paid the {$48.00} of my purchase. Shortly afterward, before the next billing period, I received a robocall from Macy 's with instructions to call a certain number and give them a number to access an "" important message about my account. '' I naively believed that the message would be that everything was settled so I followed the directions, was on hold for 15 minutes and then disconnected. I never spoke to a human being. Since then, I have received two more statements - XXXX and XXXX - and my bill is now up to {$100.00}. Macy 's robocalls me at least once, sometimes twice a day. I 've ignored the calls.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,SC,295XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/14/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,2111570

08/22/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"We applied on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and eventually closed a HARP refinance with First Mortgage Company of Idaho on XXXX XXXX, 2015. There were a number of issues with the entire process that began from the start ( i.e., rate lock without authorization ) and have continued following closing ( i.e., understated loan payoff, overstated XXXX payment ). 
1. Rate Lock - The rate was locked by the loan officer without our authorization at 4.125 %. This would have been ideal had the loan actually closed prior to lock expiration. The loan officer committed to absorbing the cost of a rate lock extension should it be needed. 
2. XXXX Mortgage Subordination - We have a XXXX mortgage that is serviced by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX required an appraisal or AVM to substantiate the value of the property. Note : XXXX did not require either to refinance the XXXX. In an attempt to save costs, the loan officer attempted to rely upon a real estate broker opinion to suffice as a AVM. XXXX XXXX rejected what was provided on a number of occasions. We used our contacts within the mortgage industry and provided the loan officer with a number of AVMs that were provided within minutes. These, along with another updated broker opinion, were ultimately provided to XXXX XXXX and accepted. It is unclear which was accepted. Regardless, the time it took for XXXX XXXX to approve the subordination request caused the interest rate lock extension fees to substantially increase. This issue was compounded by the utter lack of timely customer service offered by XXXX XXXX. Repeated phone calls by us to their customer service team expressing our frustration did not result in commitments to return phone calls. Note : The subordination team only communicates via XXXX and facsimile. If we were past due, we would surely have an account specialist assigned to us. 
3. Loan Closing - The loan file closed. However, our interest rate increased to 4.375 % from the initial lock of 4.125 %. The costs to extend far exceeded the benefit. First Mortgage absorbed some of the costs. Their argument was the delay was outside of their control ; the delay was caused by XXXX XXXX. We trusted First Mortgage and the title company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to ensure the accuracy of the information. 
4. Loan Payoff - The purpose of this loan was to refinance a loan serviced by XXXX. This should mean that the new loan amount is sufficient to pay the existing loan in full. Unfortunately, the payoff quote by XXXX did not accurately state the amount needed to payoff. The summary information that was clear and conspicuous ( at the top ) did not agree with the detail interest per diem at the bottom of the page. The closing parties relied upon the summary at the top of the page and did not reconcile. We informed the parties following the expiration of the rescission period. Unfortunately, we had to come up with an additional {$450.00}. We provided this amount on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to close the loan. Fortunately, we had adequate funds in savings. 
5. Verbal Complaint - We contacted the Idaho Department of Finance to voice our frustrations with the incorrect payoff. Was provided with contact information for XXXX XXXX. We had a conversation on XXXX XXXX, 2015 where we emphasized the TIL was understated since the new loan amount did not satisfy the existing mortgage. Ultimately, XXXX XXXX committed to reimbursing us for the amount we had to pay out of pocket. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015, we have yet to receive this check. An email was sent to XXXX with no response yet. We may have used an incorrect email address. 
6. First Mortgage Statement -- The first periodic mortgage statement stated a payment amount that exceeded the loan closing documents. The payment amount was overstated by {$50.00}. This was fixed ; however, no email or phone call from First Mortgage confirming the correction. 
We have ran out of characters to explain further.

So I prepared a nice letter and sent it with a copy of my driver 's license, proof of my social security number and proof of my mailing address so that Experian would be able to verify my identity. 
It has been at least XXXX months since I mailed my letter and I have n't heard back. When I try calling their XXXX number they want a report number before I speak with an agent and since I do n't have XXXX I ca n't speak to anyone. 
I thought that the credit companies had to respond back to me within XXXX days otherwise they are supposed to remove things from my credit report?! 
Well it 's been way more than XXXX days and all of the stuff I disputed is still there. I know I can go online and buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online but I thought that Experian is supposed to help me for free! 
I 'm at the point where I 'm done wasting time and need to get this fixed immediately.

The check turned out to be flaudurent and both our accounts were immediately frozen for all activities pending to be closed in 10 business days. I was not alerted about this action until when I tried to post an online transaction and could not therefore I called the customer service. I went to one of Wellsfargo branch, gave the copy of the check and I opened a police case. I have been a customer with the bank for over 22 years with no issues, and when they froze my account, all bill payments scheduled were not sent although I had positive balance. When Wellsfargo processed return check transaction, a return check fee was posted aganist my account. Also they posted an overdraft charge fee since my current balance did not cover the returned check vallue. I called Wellsfargo and requested them to move the funds from my XXXX account since that account had the money for the posted check and also to remove the overdraft charge but to no avail. Both my and my daugher accounts were closed with no consideration at all especially after being a customer with them for over 22 years and since I was a victim of flaud myself. Wellsfargo sanded me with transactions fees over {$50.00} dollars, my accounts are now closed and I am waiting for the check for the account balance. Their customer service was horrible and the last agent I spoke to hangup on me. I feel violated both by Wellsfargo and the papetrators of the fraud.

Based on my understanding of the letter, it looks like Experian is refusing to complete my request because they do n't think I am smart enough to write a dispute letter. 
I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my full written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them. 
I researched a dispute letter online and just used that to complete my dispute. So I guess it is possible that I may have missed something. I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report. 
I would also like to know what made my letter "" suspicious '' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that was inappropriate? 
I would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them? 
I do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts. Would completing a dispute over the phone provide me with the same benefits as the letter? And if the results would be the same, why not just accept my letter?

XXXX of the reps, XXXX XXXX, from the loss mitigation department suggested that I send in a letter requesting to cancel the modification and restart the process. He suggested I wait a week before I resubmitted my file. Then the bank put the home on auction to be sold. The rep said do n't worry he can post pone the sale as soon as the file was uploaded. The sale was postponed for 45 days but then XXXX days after receiving my complete file they denied me for a loan mod for reasons that the investor would n't allow it. 

I asked if I could then sell the property to avoid foreclosure and they said there is n't enough time but that I could try. 

I simply want to be able to avoid foreclosure and be given the time to list the home and sell it out right.

08/26/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"ATT : CUSTOMER SERVICE LOAN ID : XXXX CFPB Complaint # XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the Servicer on my mortgage ( XXXX ). One West Bank ( XXXX ) is the Investor on this mortgage. The mortgage originated with IndyMac XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. One West Bank has held homeowner in extended processing for over 5 years. XXXX XXXX is XXXX of the original Servicers along with XXXX. Currently XXXX the servicer is not evaluating documents properly. Homeowner has submitted the RMA requesting modification over three times and the same results : lost paperwork, lost statement of income/ proof if income : then denied without explanation. 

The most recent denial was on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Homeowner has generated a NPV Report, data collection date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and shows homeowner can possibly qualify for a modification. Homeowner has been in default since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

Homeowner is formally appealing the denial based on errors in home value, income and comparable recent sales : recent comp is {$230000.00}, sold in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The income, DTI and LTV Loan to Values used by the services in the denial of the RMA application are in error. I have provided a recent NPV Report dated XXXX XXXX to show more than 2 errors on the processors side : 1. The estimated homeowners value is overstated ; off by {$290000.00} 2. Current street value of the home is {$230000.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
3. Current Street Value base on recent comp sold at {$230000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

The servicer has commenced double tracking while homeowner was acting in good faith under the XXXX XXXX Agreement : the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement. Servicer has denied the homeowner a modification when was qualified. 

The servicer ' is discriminating against homeowner claims, in a form of reverse discrimination ; holding the mortgage in extended processing, denying a loan modification while homeowner is qualified, lost documents when homeowner has already provided. 

This homeowner, feels that their case has been unfairly treated for the following reasons : 1. No active single point of contact, constantly changing, when calls made to the single point of contact, routine routed to the collection department, never the same contact person. 
2. A Single point of contact was assigned ; calls were made to the point of contact : the calls were never returned by the contact. Calls returned were from the collection department and never the same so called : "" relationship manager ''. 
3. The servicer has held the homeowner in extended process in bad faith, during which the value of property has increased and fallen for 960 days from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
4. On the last RMA application : all requested documents were provided as requested. Homeowner has confirmation via fax that documents were received by the service, bank claims that documents lost. 
5. Homeowner has made numerous calls ( XXXX ) inquiring on status of application, as a foreclosure date has been set and reset ; calls were routed to next available collection department agent, comments were : A ) wrongfully advised that documents were not submitted, or B ) documents were submitted, or C ) resubmit documents because documents lost, or D ) the foreclosure date is set and homeowner is responsible for not providing the requested documents : these XXXX points are causing a state of confusion and terror to the homeowner. 
6. Servicer started a double tracking procedure upon the notice of default. The foreclosure agent was aware of the loan modification in process, and moved forward with the double tracking anyway. 
This is a clear violation under the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement ; specifically double tracking while homeowner provided all documents under good faith. 
7. Homeowner has not been updated with date of foreclosure sale.",,Ocwen,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/26/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2082671

01/27/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My husband & I applied for a XXXX Loan Modification that was approved in XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX we had trouble making the monthly payment due to a 2 week lag in pay due to a change in my job. We made a pmt of {$750.00} towards my {$1900.00} pmt by the beginning of XXXX to show good faith. Yet we received a Notice of Intention to Foreclose by XXXX XXXX. Then we made another partial pmt and again received a Notice of Intent to Foreclose the following month with 'legal fee ' of almost {$1000.00} added on. I contacted XXXX almost daily trying to find a way to bring the acct. current but I was told the total amount due including the legal fees were required and they would n't stop the foreclosure process until we paid the full amount including the attached new legal fees. Then they told me they WOULD NOT accept any partial pmts ; this all happened in a 3 month period. Frantic, we borrowed the money from my grandmother & paid the entire amount XXXX demanded. We were very upset at the time that after missing a partial pmt in XXXX, that XXXX would start foreclosure the following month and add on legal fees so quickly but, we felt completely helpless and at the mercy of XXXX. We can admit when wrong and we were wrong by making only the partial payment late but we were trying to make every effort to become current right away and we were trying to make partial payments to show good faith. Once the legal fees were attached, it was becoming impossible to catch up. I will remind you this all took place within a 2-3 months while we were still trying to making partial pmts. Anyway, once we borrowed the money to bring the acct current, we decided to put the whole disaster behind us. 
My problem now and questions are .... In XXXX XXXX sold our mortgage to Greentree XXXX Ditech. We received a letter from Greentree in XXXX XXXX informing us were eligible for the Pay for Performance incentive under XXXX. but then in XXXX XXXX Ditech sent a letter stating after an audit of our account we are actually ineligible for any of the incentives because XXXX told them we were 90+ days late back in XXXX. Ditech has now reversed XXXX credits we 've already received from a different incentive adding {$2000.00} to our principal balance and we are n't eligible for the {$5000.00} credit as well now. I have done some research and understand the incentive to be ineligible if : The borrower misses XXXX consecutive payments following the executions of the XXXX modification. ( That is, XXXX monthly payments are due and un-paid on the last day of the third month ) the, I would be considered ineligible for any of the incentives. We feel like we are being given the run-around and no one will give us straight answers. We were never 90 days pat due with XXXX in XXXX and we feel they were starting foreclosure proceeding very prematurely!!! Can you help?

Unless the original, signed contract is provided to me within 10 days of your receipt of this letter, I will be forced to assume that Citi Cards are intent on failing to comply with the law. In this case, the item must be removed from my credit report. If Citi Cards fail to respond in writing, signed by hand, in a timely manner, I will assume that Citi Cards are in error and this matter will be challenged. As Citi Cards further know, this notice has the same effect as a dispute of the accuracy of the alleged debt and Citi Cards claims. This notice is an attempt to collect evidence of your noncompliance in case further action is required. It is not a statement, election or waiver of status. 
If you fail to comply within 15 days from the dispute dated XXXX, I will file a complaint with the CFPB, XXXX. 
As of today XXXX, Citi Cards have not provided the contract with my authentic signature that begun this alleged debt. The allotted time for dispute pursuant to the FCRA has expired and the tradeline is currently reporting on the CRA.

06/23/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I deposit my pay check automatically. I monitor my account daily. Here 's the issue : when I make a transaction. It appears on my statement as pending. and my balance indicates the deduction amount. Say I have {$1000.00}, pay {$100.00} my balance shows as {$900.00} and so on. 
so I only spend what I have available. I do n't spend more than what I have. What Chase is saying is that the merchant when a trans action is pending the amount is put in reserve. 
if the merchant does not process the transaction within 5 days. The reserve is place back into my available balance. However my available balance does not indicate the reserve added back. so I had {$1000.00}, spent {$100.00}, have {$900.00} available, spend the available {$900.00}. on other bills, and then the original transaction of {$100.00} is posted, They are saying that I am overdrawn and are charge me a fee of {$35.00} so I 'm asking what happened the {$100.00} deducted from my original {$1000.00} balance. So my balance go down with every transaction but never goes back up when the pending transaction is reinstated back into my account. They say they do n't indicate that on my statement. How can I keep track of my money when not all the transactions are not indicated in my account statement. They are pulling some XXXX here and need a forensic examination of how Chase list the transaction on a costumer statement. Please advise on my next step. I 've had enough and I 'm getting the run around from Chase with no clear answers as what happened to the deducted amount from my balance. 
also transactions disappear from my statement, Case in point. I spent {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. My statement indicates the transaction the same day and my available balance is reduced by {$100.00}. 
the merchant post the transaction on the 20 5 day from the original transaction. By this time I I have depleted the remaining balance. so now I 'm overdrawn. What happened to the {$100.00} and the original transaction on XX/XX/XXXX is nowhere to be found on my statement I have a receipt from the merchant dated XX/XX/XXXX.

04/27/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"Good Morning, In XXXX XXXX I reported to ALLY financial that I was filing for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. I provided them the name of my attorney and paid the attorney for bankruptcy. The attorney and I met and there was needed documents ( Taxes, Income Statements from my divorce ). 

In short the bankruptcy was delayed. ALLY then tried to take advantage of this window and turned over the collection of this debt to a third party. ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX knowing the they had a small wind to recover the XXXX employed tactics that frankly I have never heard of in 46 years of existence. First, Somehow they got my sister address. They showed up in the middle of the night at my sisters residence and demanded that she produce the XXXX. Mind you my sister had no idea what we they were talking about as at this time she was unaware that her brother had to file bankruptcy. When she ignored their written demands, they peppered her and her neighbors yard with red and white flyers that read "" XXXX case number XXXX '' they hand wrote comments on the flyers saying "" WE NEED YOUR XXXX '' "" Why wo n't you call '' ETC ETC. The problem is that my sister had no knowledge of my bankruptcy filing. Shortly thereafter, I contacted a local attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX for assistance. 

After intentionally committing third party disclosure under the Fair Debt Collection practices act, They then received a call from me telling them that the debt was being filed in bankruptcy court. They stated to me that until the court accepted the case, they could use whatever measure needed to recover the car. I told them that was fine but they were not to harass my family. I must say they heeded this advise and to date have not contacted my sister nor Parked there tow truck behind her vehicle or called upon her neighbors again. Instead ... .. 

Somehow, the got the address of an old girlfriend. On XXXX XXXX XXXX they showed up at her home and threw red and white flyers all over her driveway. It being a windy morning many of these flyers ended up in yards throughout the neighborhood. These flyers stated "" XXXX XXXX UNDERLINE BIG BOLD PRINT "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NEED XXXX '' PHONE NUMBER XXXX NO NAME ATTACHED. 

Needless to say, this was the straw that broke the back. I received a call from my old girl friend. She was not happy. She gave me the phone number to all of her neighbors that she knew and asked me to call them all to explain to them that she is not in debt to anyone. She further requested that I come and clean her yard of all of the flyers as she has a XXXX and is unable to do so herself. 

I beg the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop the people from employing these deplorable tactics. They know what they are doing! If you google them you see their reviews are full of similar tactics and frankly they have gone unchecked by anyone and believe they can violate federal law at their leisure. I beg of you to require them to honor the law. I beg of you to insure they follow the law and further I beg of you to protect future consumes from their practices.

I also feel that Discover treated me unfairly because they have been harassing me with collections calls, even though I have opted out of phone calls. Because of the harassing calls from Discover, I felt pressured into finding a financial solution. As a result, I was scammed by a debt consolidation company, leaving me further destitute. I reported to Discover that I was the victim of a credit consolidation scam by a company called XXXX XXXX. They led me to believe they were debt consolidators, not debt negotiators. They promised to pay my creditors off in 3.5 years, but all they did was take my money and left me with nothing. All Discover has done was continue to harass me by phone causing additional anxiety and stress to me.

If they could n't adhere to my requests, them, I expected each one of the bureaus to let me know and they did not. Each letter, attached, explains my request for the items to be removed due to not being in compliance and it contains copies of my certified mailed receipts. 
For the XXXX XXXX Account, it was a secured card and sent the account to XXXX XXXX XXXX for collections. After, I called XXXX XXXX and explain that the account was a secured card account, they used my secured deposit to pay off the account and corrected my credit report and sent a notice to XXXX XXXX XXXX to remove the account and also indicate that the account was paid. XXXX XXXX XXXX can no longer collect, therefore, the credit bureau was supposed to update/correct/or remove the account. I asked this to be done during my dispute and it was n't. 
Today, I called XXXX Equifax, XXXX to informed them that they failed to respond in the manner that I requested to inform me of receipt of the documents, the dispute process, and my other requests. They acknowledge that they have my cover letter and XXXX pages of requests. They also acknowledge that they failed to respond. Due to the XXXX EquifaxXXXX not being in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I requested for the accounts to be removed. They told me that they can reinvestigate. I told them that they should n't have to reinvestigate because they failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
Therefore, I am requesting for the items to be removed from my XXXX credit files as requested. I have spent many days and hours trying to get this resolved. I also have my mortgage loan processor trying to work on this and his processor which is XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX and the loan officer told me to contact you. 
To verify the status of each account that I disputed, I personally contacted each XXXX of the creditors on the list/letter and they indicated that they do not have me in their system, but, can not provide me with a letter because I do not have an account with them. The credit bureaus claimed that they contacted the creditors. I know that they did n't investigate like they should have, because, XXXX was done in XXXX days. The customer service representative told me this. I have plenty of documentation to support this and I will seek to file this in court and seek damages if this does n't get taken care of through your organization. 
Thank you! 
The reason for the disputes is because I 'm trying to buy a home and needed my report to be cleaned up.

I 'm now 2 months behind on my payment and receive daily harassing phone calls from various states and numbers to disquise the calls. I called today for assistance as I 'm eligible for federal help and wanted to try to work with them to reduce my payments. We went through a financial profile that I had guesstimated amounts because it varies from month to month to which they told me I should have {$1000.00} a month left to pay them. So if something were to come up emergently that would leave me with less than {$300.00} to my name for a month. They would not work with me except to put me in forbearance which would cost me {$150.00} which is half of what I currently have to my name until I get paid in a week which would give me time to account for where that {$1000.00} is going.

I recently was forced to obtain a new chipped debit card, and since I have received it there has been too many problems to count. USAA is placing fraud holds on my account multiple times per day, requiring me to call them repetitively daily after most of my transactions. I have asked is this hold being placed manually or automated, and was told it is automated. The last straw was on XXXX/XXXX/2017, I made a few purchases, and my car broke down that morning. I have kids and work, so I needed a rental ASAP, when arriving to enterprise they tried to process my transaction and it declined. I then called USAA and stayed on the phone with them over an hour trying to fix the cause of the problem, which they stated was because of the transactions, I placed earlier being fraud. I told them it was me, and when the card was reactivated enterprise said they could n't use my card any more because it was declined. I then had to transfer money to another account, and pay USAA a XXXX transfer fee. Even though this whole issue was their fault. I then later needed to pay my mortgage on that day, and when trying to pay it online through XXXX, was declined again. I called USAA and was given the run around for about an hour, after all the hassle they still did not help me. I was unable to process my transaction, causing another fee with my mortgage company.

01/11/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I am writing to you because I have no other alternative. I can not stand for my rights to continue being violated by Pennymac Loan Services LLC. 

The root of the situation is that Pennymac Loan Services is reporting my mortgage opened on XXXX XXXX, 2012 as Status - Account included in Bankruptcy. THIS ACCOUNT WAS NEVER INCLUDED IN BANKRUPTCY. 

The Chapter XXXX bankruptcy that I filed was a business bankruptcy and the discharge did not include any of my personal accounts. 

The credit bureaus keep telling me that they ca n't change the "" Status - Included in Bankruptcy '' tag, because they say that it was reported to them by Pennymac. 

I have provided documentation to Pennymac for over a year, just to fall on deaf ears and not have any of my calls returned. 

Pennymac has treated me like a second class citizen and has completely disrespected me at every turn. Because of this experience, I feel like I have been maliciously violated and deeply wounded by Pennymac. 

Having this mortgage incorrectly say that it was included in bankruptcy is stopping me from getting a small business loan needed for my business to operate. This is like pouring salt into the wound. 

I am begging you to demand that Pennymac Loan Services send me a letter of apology for these violations of my Civil Rights. 

Additionally, please have them immediately remove any reference to Status - Included in bankruptcy from my consumer credit files with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX credit bureaus. 

Thank you VERY much for existing to help the "" little guy '' in this world. I very much wish that there were more of you. 

Please notify me immediately of the positive results of your investigation. 

It is my wish that you have a very safe and happy new year!

05/11/2016,Credit card,,Payoff process,,"This complaint is regarding Citi Credit Card, the issuer of XXXX credit card 's unfair and deceptive acts. XXXX varying amounts were charged to Citi/XXXX Credit Card in conjunction to XXXX deferred interest promotion. The first amount of {$1300.00} charged to Citi/XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX, XXXX was the initial payment toward the Bathroom ( tub replacement ) at my XXXX XXXX XXXX and the remaining balance of {$2800.00} was charged to the same Citi/XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX, XXXX when the job was completed. A new charge for a bedding in the amount of {$700.00} was charged to this Citi/XXXX card on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and a the last purchase in amount of {$1300.00} for electronic equipment/accessories was charged to this same Citi/XXXX card on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

The subject of this dispute is how my monthly payments under the deferred interest promo was applied towards this Citi/XXXX account. I understand that any payment made will first be applied towards the oldest account ( the account whose promo date ends first. With the exception of accounts that are in dispute. When an account is in dispute, it will be placed in hold until such time the matter causing such dispute is resolved. Despite numerous calls to the bank 's customer representative, and emails/messages requesting Citi/XXXX to readjust my account balance by recalculation the payments and applying them towards the accounts that are not in dispute, Citi/XXXX has acted unfairly and in a deceptive manner by continuing to apply my payments towards paying down the amount in dispute. Adding insult to injury, Citi XXXX continues to levy interest charges when there is no late payments whatsoever that would trigger such interest charges to be added. 

Based on my calculations, The entire amount that is not in dispute is all paid -up way ahead of the promo 's end dates. In fact, there is an overpayment which will have to be applied towards the amount in dispute bringing the amount in dispute from $ {$2800.00} per Citi/XXXX records down to {$2200.00}. This is the amount that I have to pay once XXXX XXXX XXXX has made the necessary repairs/to the bathroom. Henceforth, no more payments will be made since all amounts have been paid ( and overpaid ) leaving the disputed amount open and said amount in dispute will be paid upon completion/resolution of the matter that is the subject of the dispute.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,NY,105XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/23/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1919949

08/17/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I am the cosigner on a Wells Fargo student loan that was taken out by my niece to finance her XXXX degree. At the time of the application, I wanted to be sure I was n't signing up for a long term commitment. I was told before any documents were signed that after two years, I could apply to have my name taken off the loan, so long as there was a history of on-time payments. I felt that was a bit excessive, since in most cases a cosigner can be removed after one year, but I wanted to get the loans consolidated with a lower interest rate. Silly me. 
At this time, it has been over four years and I am still being held hostage as a cosigner, even though the payment requirement has been fulfilled for longer than required. Additionally, although I am held responsible for the loan, Wells Fargo will not provide me with any information regarding disposition of the loan, everything must be channelled through my niece. She is also the one who must apply to have my name taken off the loan, which is not the way it was presented to me. It apppears Wells Fargo has stacked the deck so that I will never be removed as a cosigner, though that is n't the way it was presented in the beginning. 
The loan is serviced through payroll deductions, so it 's not as though a payment will be forgotten or missed. If a borrower has a record of repayment this long, I would say it 's a pretty safe bet that the necessity of having a cosigner is a moot point, and Wells Fargo should honor their promise to remove my name from the loan.

03/01/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my mortgage servicer ( XXXX ) notified me the rate on my ARM was going up to 3.625 % from 3.25 % and my payment as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX would be {$940.00}, up from {$910.00} the year before. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I got notice from XXXX that they would no longer be servicing my mortgage. All payments due on or after XXXX/XXXX/XXXX were to be paid to Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ). Nothing else would change. So I sent XXXX 's payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and they received it XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have copies of the cancelled check. XXXX 's payment has been received and verified by XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX my wife called SLS to verify our account number, payment amount and where to send it since this was our first payment to them and we did n't have a statement from them yet. They verified the account # and address but the amount due was now {$58.00} higher per month, up to {$1000.00}, even though nothing was supposed to change and the interest rate was still the same. I have a letter from SLS stating "" No other terms of your note and mortgage will change ''. My wife went back and forth with them on this a little bit before I got involved. When I did I asked for an amortization schedule showing how they arrived at this new amount totaling an additional {$700.00} per year. Numbers do n't lie. Amortize {$180000.00} over 290 months at a rate of 3.625 % with a payment of {$1000.00}. It wo n't work. They sent me an amortization schedule with the wrong balance because they are saying I did n't make XXXX 's payment and they used a rate of 3.25 % with a payment of {$910.00}! Since then I have spoken with XXXX or XXXX representatives from SLS. Not one of them can tell me where the additional {$58.00} comes from. I pay my own insurance and my own property taxes. They have never said that was where the additional monthly amount came from. They go to talk to a supervisor and then they rush me off the phone. I have sent them a qualified written request for information in the form of an email and I have not gotten a response. I have since been told my account in delinquent and that they have not received XXXX 's payment. I have informed them multiple times that it was sent to XXXX and that they need to contact them if they think it belongs to them. They have not. They still say it is delinquent and that I have not made a payment since XXXX. The week of XXXX XXXX I received XXXX letters of intent to foreclose, so I sent them XXXX types of proof of my payment to XXXX, I sent them the interest rate increase notification with the new amount and rate and the copy of their letter stating nothing will change, I sent them XXXX 's and XXXX 's payments for {$940.00} each, so I am current until XXXX XXXX. Today they sent a photographer out to my house to proceed with the foreclosure. I have not received any communication from them whatsoever other than threatening to foreclose for payments I have not missed. They offered to modify my loan and stretch out my mortgage with lower payments. Which I think is one of their intentions ; to re-write my loan. I do n't need lower payments. I need an honest mortgage servicer that is not trying to steal my home. My loan to value is about XXXX %. This has moved from a notice of a delinquent payment to foreclosure at lightning speed. About 4 weeks, maybe less. Especially when I have n't missed a payment. Now they likely wo n't cash XXXX 's and XXXX 's payments because they consider them partial payments even though I sent documentation that {$940.00} is the correct amount. No one calls me back or even acknowledges me. I can no longer attribute treatment like this to incompetence. I think something criminal is going on. For one, they will make money on my home based on loan to value. They have never contacted XXXX for XXXX 's payment. Four weeks from "" delinquent '', which I am not, to foreclosure!? Unheard of!

06/07/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I am completely and utterly disgusted with the level of account accountability and Customer Service provided by KEYBANK. I have been a consumer of this company for over 3 years and have always maintained a pleasant relationship with my local office and bankers until beginning of XXXX. This year due to an identity theft situation internally in the IRS, a delay was placed on my XXXX income tax return. Once notified of the delay I immediately contacted KeyBank to inform them of the automatic delayed deposit and the effects it will have on my automatic withdrawals. My local banker confirmed the understanding a note was supposedly placed on file. This was not the case ... During my time fighting back and forth with the IRS my "" friendly '' KeyBank account was charged multiple fees for the extended period that the account was overdrawn as well as fees for Inactivity. This continued until I was notified by mail that KEY has charged off my account and it was now closed. I thin contacted KEy and the outside agency, I was told KEY policy is that any and all funds received for deposit to a closed account will be automatically returned to sender. THIS WAS NOT DONE. After being notified on XXXX XXXX, by a branch of the IRS that funds were released to me and not sent back as I was expecting, I contacted Key again. At this time I was informed by a corporate XXXX that on XXXX XXXX KEYBANK received and cashed my first installment from the IRS ( WHICH IS AGAINST POLICY ), then stated to have mailed me a physical check with could take 4 weeks from that date to reach me. ( WHEN I LIVE 2 MINUTES FROM A LOCAL BRANCH ). Two weeks later I contacted the corporate branch again got anther XXXX agent, whom after verifying my identity immediately told me she knew why I was calling, and transferred me to collections department, this department informed me of the company policy to send back all fund submitted for deposit to closed accounts. After further discussion she decided to look into my claim and confirmed that the payment was cashed by KEY and a check should have been sent. I was then told to allow the opportunity for research to be done on the account an I would receive a call back. NEEDLESS to say this was not done. Week later I contacted the corporate office again and was told that nothing could be done for me to assist in the resolution in the matter and the agent would have look into the issue and would guarantee to call me back the following business day by XXXX. ONCE again THIS NEVER HAPPENED. Today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called KEYBANK again, I got a XXXX who was very rude and unhelpful, who was only interested in over talking me and ranting company policy, in a matter that was created from Key violating company policy from the beginning. The obnoxious agent then proceeded to transfer me to the collections department. Where I spoke with a XXXX, who confirmed multiple attempts made by me to resolve this issue as well as an unusually long delay in getting my funds back to me. Rep confirmed my address, and proceeded to inform me of a procedure of me filing an affidavit to stop the check and mailing it to KEYBANK for KEY to then mail me another check. Which was ridiculous! Rep understood my frustration and got me over to the escalation department, where I spoke with a supervisor whom asked me to allow her the ability to look into the situation, which was housed in another department.

05/04/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My Home mortgage is on a Bill Pay with my bank. The payment is due by the XXXX of every month and I have scheduled it for XXXX of every month to avoid any weekend, holiday type delays. Any way during the month of XXXX my payment was auto-scheduled and processed on XXXX of XXXX. I was out on business and when I returned on XXXX XXXX I noticed there were missed calls on my home phone from "" XXXX '' on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I called this number back and found out that this number belonged to my Mortgage Company. Once I verified my security information the first word I heard from the representative was "" Sir, how would you like to pay {$130.00}? "". My immediate response was where did this come from? I was calling back to find out why the I had these missed calls ( note no message was left on my answering system by Seterus ) was calling me for which I had no idea. The representative "" XXXX '' upon asking first said maybe because my payment was received after XXXX and was charged late fee. I told her that let me look on the bill payment, upon which I clarified to XXXX that my payment was scheduled for XXXX of the month ahead of the due date of XXXX so it can not be correct. XXXX then went on hold and then came back stating that my Escrow analysis had established that instead of my monthly payment of {$1800.00} I was to make a revised payment of {$1900.00}. Hene the shortfall of {$64.00} combined with LATE FEE of {$72.00} was overdue now. I tried to convince XXXX that this was not a delibrate mistake or intended delay, there was no information on my end that my payment had changed and XXXX did not leave any messages when they called. So I pleaded that given my pristine payment record at a minimum I should not be charged the LATE FEE. Especially given that no payment from ESCROW was due until XXXX timeframe and it did not make sense to levy a penalty of {$72.00} on a shortfall lesser than that and which was not even due to either the Real-Estate Property Tax payment OR my Home insurance. XXXX said she can not do anything. I insisted to talk to her supervisor. When XXXX 's Supervisor "" XXXX XXXX '' came on line I told her this honest oversight should be considered for waiving the LATE FEE. XXXX held on to my first statement and re-phrased Oh! so you agree it was an oversight. I knew then and there she was trying to justify Seterus 's late fee by mounting on me that I was to be fully responsible for this oversight. And then between XXXX and XXXX they furthered the topic with threats for credit reporting if the overdue amount was not paid. Since I enjoy a credit score in XXXX range I did not want to argue with them and caved in to make the whole payment via direct debit from my checking account on the spot. I think it is fare if you levy LATE FEE and PENALTIES for something that has caused financial damage or has the potential to do so - but in my case it was plain simple that Seterus came back with a response of "" Oh I got you ''. Very mischevious tactics for such meagre amounts from customers who have been on the dot with payments from last umpteen years.

Recently there was a Federal lawsuit against the Parent company ( EDMC ) of the college I attended ( XXXX XXXX of XXXX ) from XXXX graduated with XXXX and over {$80000.00} in debt. Its Parent company EDMC was sued for fraudulent practices/recruiting/using federal aid for CEOs/Shareholders/recruiters bonuses instead of helping students, predatory lending practices, stealing GI Bill money from students, etc ... and they won {$11.00} XXXX dollars from EDMC. 

I was lied to about their job placement numbers as well as the true total cost of my so-called quality education. Also they were predatory in recruiting and they pressured me into keep signing for more student loans, federal and private. The education I received there was sub par at best and I feel was n't anywhere near worth what it cost to get my soon to be worthless degree. The lawsuit money that was won should go to the students who are the real victims not to the government for more wasteful spending. It should go to the people, this country was built upon a government for the people by the people, not for the wealthy or for the money by the money. I have almost all my records while I attended XXXX XXXX of XXXX. 

We want the settlement money to erase all our student loans as well as have all money refunded that has been paid on the grounds of the fraud the schools committed based on the judgement in the US Government lawsuit. Below are links to the site for the petition about the lawsuit and the debts former students are drowning in along with many other source sites. Many of us have begun to contact elected officials, State Attorney Generals, and looking into going after them. 

Now EDMC is closing most of its schools throughout the country and just as the XXXX XXXX closures opened everyone 's eyes to the thousands of people drowning in debt from attending this fraudulent school that should receive refunds as well as all student debt erased based on everything that has happened. 

Read the comments listed on the site with the petition and you will see what I 'm talking about. This money should go to all of us who are still stuck with this debt from a school that played us all for fools. 

Thank you for your time.

08/12/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I contacted BOA XX/XX/XXXX to let them know we wanted to short sale the home. I was told we had to apply for and be denied a modification first. I provided the requested documents, was contacted for more documents, and this cycle continued for five months. Despite sending in a requested letter of explanation on my situation in XX/XX/XXXX, and requesting a short sale, NOT a modification, my file remained in review for modification until XX/XX/XXXX. I 've heard multiple stories about the process to get this done and have received bad information, faxes and emails were "" LOST '' phone calls NOT returned, etc., all to find out I am still in the beginning stages of NOTHING. All the while, I have a contract for purchase on my home that was signed months and months ago. Most recently, my real estate agent was asked to open a file in equator and when she attempted to do so, was unable to due to "" lender placed property is already active '' error message. She reached out to BOA for help in getting access to my property in equator to move this along, and after several messages to XXXX people ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX ext. XXXX. His manager is XXXX XXXX - XXXX ), they still have not received a call back. The first message was left on XX/XX/XXXX ( SEVEN days prior to today ). I have also called the manager referenced above ( XXXX XXXX ) and have not received a call back. I have done everything in my grasp to make this situation right, and it 's dragging out longer every time I turn around. I can never speak to the same person at BOA and get different information almost every single time I call. With a check of the phone conversations ( which are recorded ) you can see the different stories I have been given. You can also look at the log of information BOA requested, and notice how quickly I have provided everything they ask for, sometimes more than once. The buyer who placed a contract on my home has to move from his current home XX/XX/XXXX. We are nearing that date and he is going to walk away if we can not make some headway here. This company is disorganized, lacking in basic knowledge and completely lacking in efficiency. I am seeking a manager or leader of some sort who can help me through this process. It has been over seven agonizing months of chasing my tail. While I understand a short sale can take time, unfortunately, I have n't even made it to that department yet due to sheer incompetence. Thank you for any help you can provide.

Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine.

Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3.

Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6.

I called before application to make sure I was eligible for the offer ( which was confirmed by Amex phone representative ). Also, I called after approval to double check the terms and again was told I 'm eligible. After I spent {$3000.00} I saw XXXX points pending, but after a while they disappeared. After another 2 calls to Amex in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I was told that it takes 6-8 weeks for points to post, but they are coming. 

I just got off the phone with Amex representative ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) and I was informed that my account is ineligible for the sign up offer because I had a similar product back in XXXX and now all personal Amex credit cards have once in a lifetime signup bonuses. 

This was the first time I was informed I was n't eligible. I repeat before I applied for the card and while I was satisfying spending requirements I was told multiple times I am eligible for the sign up bonus. I feel Amex was intentionally deceptive and outright misleading in making me spend the required amount ( {$3000.00} ), paying annual fee ( {$470.00} ) upfront, and only then pulling the rug from under me. 

I request Amex credits my account with XXXX points are per sign up offer. There were multiple opportunities to notify me that I 'm ineligible for the sign up offer when I was inquiring about it a ) before I sign up b ) at least 3 calls after I signed up. 

I conservatively value XXXX Amex XXXX point at XXXX cents, so XXXX XXXX points is {$1500.00}.

On XXXX XXXX I went into the branch and spoke with the XXXX regarding this incident. He informed me that the bank sets people up to fail by paying highest to lowest incoming items. He also informed me that this bank currently has a lawsuit going on against them for this type of behavior. He further more informed me that several other large banks around this area have already been challenged with this very practice and been forced to change the way they do this. He told me that XXXX XXXX would not change it unless the government forced them to because it is such a large money maker for the bank. If they would have use chronological time instead of highest to lowest as an honest way of calculating overdraft charges, I would have been charge only {$38.00} instead of {$260.00} that day. I also feel that charging a {$38.00} overdraft fee for a XXXX or even a {$10.00} charge is quite over the line. I have attached copies of my online banking showing this incident. This is not the first time this has occurred for me but I am a senior cistizen livng on a fixed income and feel that I am being taken advantage of. I appreciate any help that you can assist me with in this matter.

I eventually hung up and dialed again. The second representative hung up on me as soon as I mentioned cancellation.

06/03/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"A Citibank loan officer sold us a mortgage based on a "" rate protection program '' whereby the interest rate of the mortgage could be reset to a lower rate under certain circumstances. Before the loan was issued, the loan officer stated that we had qualified for the program. After the loan was issued, the loan officer confirmed that the rate protection program applied to our loan. 
Some time post-issuance, we inquired about exercising the rate reset under the program, but Citi stated that our loan was not covered by the program. 
The issuing loan officer left Citi after the loan was issued. However, he confirmed in writing that he had indicated to us before and after the loan was issued that our loan was covered by this program. Citi has received his written statement acknowledging this but Citi refuses to cooperate and refuses to stand by the representations made by their former employee. 
Initially, Citi said there was no record of a commitment by Citi to include the rate protection in the loan. Then, Citi said they could not include it because my loan could not have qualified under the terms of the program because the program did not cover XXXX homes. I have reviewed a flyer outlining the terms and conditions of the program and there is nothing on the flyer that would suggest that XXXX homes are excluded. In any event, the loan officer was aware this was a mortgage for a second home and nevertheless represented that the program had been applied to the mortgage. Citi 's final position is that the bank is willing to do nothing and will not stand by the representations made by its former employee, even if those statements induced us into taking a loan with Citi.

08/20/2016,Credit card,,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,,"I recently opened a Macy's/American Express card . Shortly thereafter, I received a bill with XXXX fraudulent charges - XXXX {$20.00} refills for XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and reported the fraudulent usage and closed the account. 
I have had the same experience with another XXXX account that I had held for more than 20 years. Over the last year, my account was compromised XXXX times. Each time I reported it, received new cards and the charges were reversed however, XXXX did nothing to secure my account as it kept happening so I closed it. 
Today I received a letter ( with an incorrect account number ) asking for the same information I had provided when I first reported the fraud and requesting I submit a copy of my driver 's license, social security card, work ID, etc. Needless to say I had no intention of supplying that information to them via mail or in any other format as they obviously have poor security standards. 
When I called to protest, I was initially told if I did n't submit the information my dispute could not be processed and the intimation was I would be responsible for the charges. I reiterated that I was not submitting my personal information and I was then transferred to a supervisor who said I did n't have to if I was "" uncomfortable '' doing so but they would still need the form and reiterated that my dispute would not be processed without it. 
I have disputed any number of charges in the past with numerous banks and retailers, that were either in error, fraudulent or when I could not get satisfaction from a merchant. Never once have I been required to complete a paper form after completing the form online or speaking with a representative directly and I have absolutely no faith in XXXX XXXX to handle this correctly.

02/11/2016,Bank account or service,Savings account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"In XXXX I opened an HSA account with Bank of America. Since that time, and despite numerous requests, BOA has not provided me with the ability to use the funds in that account to pay what are now overdue medical bills. To add insult to injury, BOA is charging monthly fees for the funds I ca n't access, and wants to charge me a fee to close the account so that I can move the funds elsewhere. 
Long Description : On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted Bank of America via email with questions about opening an HSA account. A representative responded, and I followed that up with a phone call during which I was told to go to my local branch to open the HSA account. About 3 weeks later, when I had time to go during banking hours, I set an appointment ; the appointment form indicated I was coming in to open an HSA account. I arrived on time for the appointment. After waiting about 30 minutes I finally interrupted a bank officer walking through the lobby to ask what was happening and when my appointment would be met. She checked and indicated they had no record of an appointment but I had the printout showing the appointment. At that time she found someone to meet with me, and that person advised me that they could not open an HSA as it could only be done online. So, I went back home and XXXX I went ahead and opened the account on online. 
I subsequently received a letter in the mail, dated XXXX XXXX, advising me that the account was open and I would shortly receive a XXXX debit card which could be used to pay for health care expenses. I waited patiently but no card arrived. After a while ( not sure the date ), I called and was told the card had been mailed, but they could create and mail another card. The representative explained that it had been sent in a plain white envelope, so maybe I missed it. I told her I would recheck before having them send another card. Both my husband and I checked every piece of mail that had come in and there was no card. So, I called back and asked to have a new card sent. I was told it would be 7-10 business days. I waited this period and called after no card was received. BOA agreed to send another card. I waited and when no card came I called again. The first person who responded told me it was about a week to get the new card ready and then 7-10 business days after it was mailed. I was later told that it was 7-10 business days from the date of the request. So, I waited still longer, and again no card. I called again.I asked if I could get a card on an expedited basis as this was getting to be a real problem, and was told there was no such process available ; I needed to wait a few more days, or they could send another card and that would be another 7-10 days. So, I waited more, but again no card arrived. 
On XXXX XXXX I called and told them I was desperate. I spoke with "" XXXX '' who agreed that he would apply for a new card to be prepared on an expedited basis. XXXX promised that he would have someone call me the next morning ( he was off in the morning ) to confirm the expedited card. No call came that morning. At XXXX in the afternoon of XXXX XXXX XXXX called me and explained that folks had been busy and he had been in for about an hour not able to call. He then advised that BOA had agreed to expedite the card and I should receive it in 3-5 business days. So, I waited and checked the mail every day. No card arrived on the XXXX business day ( XXXX XXXX ). After much rigmarole he advised that the card had been produced on an expedited basis but things fell through the cracks and it sat at the production site and was not actually mailed until XXXX XXXX. Further he advised that the expedited part was how fast the card was produced but it was still sent regular mail. So, if we use 7-10 business days from XXXX XXXX I should see the card by the XXXX -- making it over 2.5 months that I have not had a card.

10/28/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We have a mortgage on a rental home that turned out to be a XXXX adjustable. This past XXXX, 2015, it adjusted and the PITI increased by {$900.00}. We contacted the mortgage holder, ASC, and inquired about a modification. For 4 months we submitted paperwork to them. They asked for paperwork that appeared to have nothing to do with the modification requested. All docs were provided yet they asked for the same documentation over and over and over and over. Ultimately we were denied. On the phone our "" representative - XXXX XXXX XXXX '' said we were denied because the property was titled to our XXXX. However the letter we received from ASC said that we were denied because we were NOT behind on our payments. We appealed with reasoning based on the Denial Letter rather than that verbally given by XXXX XXXX. Denied again, even though the property had since been Quit Claimed out of the XXXX and back into my name. XXXX XXXX continues to say the denial was due to the XXXX titling and that our only option is to re-apply for another modification. We have asked XXXX XXXX for documentation showing the denial was due, as he continually says, to the prop being in an XXXX AND for the HAMP guidelines to see if we 're wasting our time requesting a modification. He refuses to provide either, and double-talks us when we point out the inconsistency between what he tells us and the letters we 've gotten from ASC. 

On-line research into ASC shows that there are an amazing amount of complaints against the company relating to modifications including delays, denials or giving specific instructions for people to get behind in their payments so as to qualify for a modification ... and then foreclosing rather than modifying. In our case we feel we were jerked around for 4, now 6, months making payments to ASC rather than shopping for a refinance. For 4 months our file was reviewed by an Underwriter who seemingly had no training at all - evidenced by continual requests for documentation already provided and an obvious failure to understand what was submitted ( we are XXXX ). And now we are being told to re-apply by XXXX XXXX. In an email request for specific modification guidelines, XXXX XXXX states that his supervisor told him he is unable to provide written guidelines for the modification. He also refuses to provide the letter stating we were denied because the property is in a company name. Are n't we entitled to a valid denial letter? Are n't we entitled to know what criteria we need to meet in order to qualify? It seems as if it is a moving target without any specifics, so denials and approvals are random. We are being given a run around and now XXXX XXXX is not answering emails at all. This is definitely fraudulent.

05/29/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"approximately XXXX years ago my home loan was sold to OCWEN by Indy Mac Bank during the time the loan was transitioning from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate. My payments at the time with Indy Mac was {$2500.00} until the agreement was to change XX/XX/XXXX ( adjustable rate based on current interest rate ). OCWEN was suppose to mail me new payment schedule XXXX days prior to XX/XX/XXXX which they did n't. I mailed a mortgage check on XX/XX/XXXX for the normal amount which they received and cashed. I was called a few weeks later from an OCWEN rep inquiring why my payment was n't made? after several min of arguing she admitted they received my check cashed it and was holding it in another account because the amount sent was "" too much ''. The new amount for XX/XX/XXXX was {$1900.00}. I paid this amount for the entire year with NO issues, calls correspondence from OCWEN. prior to XX/XX/XXXX I waited for the supposed "" XXXX day letter '' letting me know what my new payment schedule was because I knew the current interest rate was lower than prior year. The notification never came and I mailed a payment of {$1900.00} as normal and the same issue arose again. Phone call after phone call from different reps asking why my payment was n't made? similar to last time a rep finally admitted they received my check XX/XX/XXXX as normal however it was n't the right amount and they were holding it? per my XXXX Bank the check was cashed. The rep I was speaking to told me my new payment schedule was {$2600.00} which was curious because the interest rate had lowered. I contested this and I was transferred to an escalation manager XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX who took my information and confirmed I was current on my account, no delinquency noted and the previous rep was WRONG with his calculations. He assured me he would research this and would contact me in XXXX business days with a specific time he was calling. He called the very next day and told me "" OCWEN made a mistake, your new rates as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$1.00}, XXXX '' "" The {$1.00}, XXXX being held would be applied to XXXX 's payment obligation and the overage would be applied to principal balance ''. He assured me the phone calls would stop and if they continued to contact him via email : XXXXXXXXXXXX. The harassing phone calls continued relentlessly from OCWEN reps claiming I have n't made my payments and when I explained to them XXXX XXXX the escalation manager took care of your mistake they would not except that as an answer. The would not transfer me to him they would only email him on my behalf to have him call me at which time he has not called me. I emailed XXXX XXXX on dates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX explaining my situation and asking for help to no avail. I try to call the only number provided however it is answered by a voice mail when prompted to my account states "" they have received my payment of {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and my new rate is {$1500.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX ''. When prompted to a live person its a call center in XXXX and the reps state the same thing "" this situation was escalated to Manager XXXX XXXX and he is investigating the matter and will get back to you ''. They always transfer to another escalation manager who immediately states I owe them {$2600.00} a month and also agree my new rate is {$1500.00} which is frustrating and confusing. They also agree that my account has never been delinquent and I have never missed a payment however the harassing calls continue. Each new manager assures me they will email XXXX XXXX to call me which he does not. On XX/XX/XXXX I a received certified letter from OCWEN stating I am in default and they are moving to foreclose on my property if I do not respond in XXXX days by phone call ( same XXXX number that goes to an XXXX call center ) or written form. I received a new payment invoice for XXXX payment which now states my new payment is {$1100.00} which now contradicts everything.

It is very difficult to get a hold of a person because of the way they have their automated phone system set up and when I finally do get a hold of someone, such as the last time I called, which was today, and spoke with XXXX, I got told things like, "" we issued the check on XXXX XXXX, but please keep in mind that it takes 10 to 15 business days to receive the check ''. When I pull up the calendar and tell her that 10 to 15 business days already past last week, she says she is not the postal service and can not help me. When I ask her to confirm to me via email that this check was sent out she says she ca n't help me. So then I have to ask to speak to a manager and then get put on hold again. When the manager finally gets on the phone he tells me that the customer service representative gave me incorrect information and that the check was mailed XXXX XXXX and I should get it by next week at the latest. 
This has happened repeatedly. The overcharge was in XXXX and I have been calling Synchrony Bank numerous times since then.

08/04/2016,Credit card,,Late fee,,"Capital One case # XXXX Agent : "" XXXX '' Rep ID XXXX XXXX During my honeymoon ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) I was traveling outside the country ( XXXX ) and did not have the ability to submit my credit card payment on time ( Due XX/XX/XXXX ). I called once back in the USA to make payment, and to ask about the late fee being waved. I was placed on hold while the rep verified she could waive my late fee. I was told my late fee would be waved. I informed the rep that was great news, but that I would also like to INCREASE my payment from the minimum amount due to {$200.00}. The rep told me she would have to confirm with her supervisor that had I INCREASED the amount due, that she could still waive my late fee. I said OK I will wait for you to ask again, but before she placed me on hold she began to read me the authorization RSNIP to complete my payment of {$200.00}. I told her "" No, I do not authorize you to process my payment until you confirm my late fee will be waved ''. The rep told me SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PROCESS MY PAYMENT BEFORE CONFIRMING THE LATE FEE WILL STILL BE WAVED. This was a clear act of discrimination based on me increasing the amount I wanted to pay. This allowed the rep to take my payment, and then place me on hold only to come back and say "" we can no longer waive your late fee ''. This deceptive practice is being taught to new call center representatives at Capital One. When I spoke with her supervisor, her supervisor and I exchanged a conversation in which I told him I work in compliance at a bank and in no way what I just heard was legal or ethical. He tried to end the call and confirmed with me while I was on the phone that my payment will be processed. He never processed my payment, and not only was I still left with a late fee, my late payment was not processed. 

I had to try and use my card again to find out that no one processed my payment when I spoke on the phone with them for multiple hours trying to get them to take my money ( the entire basis of their organization ). I became incredibly frustrated at the deliberate attempts to affect my credit by not taking my payment ( This is all on a recorded line, they opened a case, referenced above, and agreed with me that their reps did not act accordingly ). 

I would like a case opened as the 2nd call I placed I was told they could not take my payment while the recorded calls were being investigated. It took a THIRD call for someone to tell me I was able to "" catch up '' with the late payment ( that I had already authorized to take back in XX/XX/XXXX, but was not processed on their end ) to avoid a continual late fee. 

Once the case was closed, a representative called me back to confirm their rep did not follow protocol and that the only thing they could do to honor me was waive the late fee and reduce my minimum payments. I said to the guy "" Are you nuts? Why would I let you lower my fee so that I would just pay MORE interest over a longer period of time? '' When my whole basis of the call was to INCREASE my mim. payment. The {$200.00} auto-pay was finally set up, but the late fee STILL IS NOT WAIVED. 

I can be contacted at XXXX for any related follow up necessary regarding these issues. I want to know fines involved for their blatant discrimination. Thank you",,Capital One,NY,146XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/04/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2046146

04/29/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"Hello, my name is XXXX XXXX and I am a 2011 graduate of XXXX XXXX University with a student loan outstanding debt ( XXXX XXXX, Discover Bank ) of a small house in the country. The only major problem I have with that is the outstanding amount the loan company asked me to pay every month, which I was n't able to do. It 's the equivalent to a monthly lease on an apartment. This caused me to be referred to a lawyer firm to "" collect debt '', XXXX XXXX XXXX to be exact. I 'm constantly being harassed that I should settle or increase my payments. Both of which I ca n't do because I do n't make that amount of money to be able to do just yet. I 've asked to be on a lower payment plan and I was denied. I 've asked what other options I have that could be worked out with me having to pay rent, eat, actually go to work to make money, etc. Nothing is really being done apart from the phrase "" if you do n't increase your payments soon, there is n't much I can do. I 'm doing the best that I can, but clearly it is n't enough. The flip side to that is that I did n't land a job in the field that I graduated from. I 'm using what I did go to school for just a little bit. In all reality, I could 've just purchased software and used trial and error to figure this thing out. Now I 'm stuck paying this super huge amount of money back and the only thing I feel like was actually worth asking for a loan was the living expense that helped me get started in a new city as a young adult. At this point, I 'm sure I 've paid off that amount of living. 

In all reality, I do not believe that XXXX XXXX University is worth taking out this much debt unless you already have something established prior to attending. After doing research and hearing the amount of complaints with this school and the graduation rate, the proof is there. I have contacted the other student loan help ( which worked ) concerning federal loans ( subsidized, unsubsidized ), now I would like to have my private loans reviewed to hopefully get a similar result.

We were attempting to short sale our home. We stabilized and began making full monthly payments around XX/XX/XXXX but did not get the arrears caught up for 10 months but we made full monthly payment for the full monthly amount due. The company reported to the credit agencies that we missed XXXX payments. They said they had the right to do that because the arrears where not current. They kept applying the new payments to the ones in arrears and reporting late payments for the current months we were paying. Do we have any protection from the law regarding this and if so what is the legal statute, where can I find it please? Thank you.

On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I spoke with a representative from Location services who claimed that I needed to set up payments for a balance of XXXX that I owe to XXXX. XXXX has gone into my bank account and taken payments on a balance that I owed them from the original loan of XXXX. XXXX even sent a letter to me stating that I only owed them XXXX and if I were to bring that payment in to them that I would be eligible to re-loan with the company. 
When I questioned the representative from Location Services about the balance his reply was "" I dont know either '' and he hung up the phone on me after I explained to him that I dont owe that much from XXXX and that they received payments directly from my checking account. To me it seems as though this collection agency is trying to collect funds.

I had a late payment on XXXX occasions in XXXX and XXXX and had arrangements to pay. They still called my place of employment for payment before the agreement date came. I called the main office and asked them to not call my job and reminded them they have my cell and home number and should use those. I was told they use an automated dialer and they would take measures to see that this shouldn't happen again. The same thing happened with the XXXX payment agreement. I again called and asked them to remove my work number because when they call they just ask for ""XXXX"" as though they are a friend or family member. I was told they would note not to call my employer. There came a time when I missed another payment and they started calling my job again several times a day. I explained I only work XXXX day a week at most and if I am not home to take the call they call my employer. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message saying my account was eligible for loan rehab. I spoke with representatives every day for the next few weeks who told me they would send me an email with the details of the rehab program, I explained that each person before them promised to send the email but I have never received it. I spoke with someone named XXXX later in XXXX who stated she would personally be handling my case from now on and she also never sent the email. Now I am getting calls many times a day and usually speak with XXXX people a day who say they will send the email. There was one occasion when they called my job in XXXX and I explained I was at work, a XXXX used her ""XXXX"" so i had to answer it. I asked the rep if I could call them back when I went on break. She continued to talk to me about my late payment. My superior was sitting near me and told me I can't have calls that disrupt my job like that and someone calls me daily at work and this had to stop. On XXXX I was at work and they called again. I asked the rep if my work number has a note or something showing they should not be calling and she stated ""no"" but she would be removing it from the system. I got calls XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, On XXXX @XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. These are just the times from the most recent calls. There have been days when I speak with at least XXXX people in one day. XXXX I spoke with  XXXX who informed me they don't have the loan rehab program and now they have a ""fresh start"" program which just starts the loan all over again. They have the loan rehab details in writing but she won't send me that because it won't help me (and they don't offer that anymore) I have to use the the fresh start and for that program they have nothing in writing. She also stated that my work number shows up in red but it is still on my account. There seems to be a lot of misinformation coming from this company I've offered to make arrangements that I know I can keep but that is not acceptable to them. My working depends on the amount of XXXX and recently it has been sparse. I ask for things in writing now since I see it is a practice of them to just say anything to get you to make a payment with no thought as to how they are treating their customers. I have written them via email to make them aware I am seeking advice and help and also to report their actions. I have also been told to speak with the store to see if they would take the merchandise back and they would remove the loan.  this was also untrue as the store doesn't do refunds.

08/17/2015,Debt collection,I do not know,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"This collection agency calls my work phone XXXX times/day asking for someone named XXXX . I do not know anyone named XXXX. I have contacted them several times asking them to remove my number from their list. 

The last time I called asking them to remove my number was XXXX/XXXX/15. They called me again at XXXX XXXX. on XXXX/XXXX/15. I asked them to remove my number again. They then called back at XXXX XXXX. I asked them to remove my number again and I was rudely told, "" your number is not in our system. There is no number to remove. '' So I asked how they were able to call me if my number was not in their system. The woman stated that she did n't know. I told her the problem I was having and that I did not want to receive any more phone calls from her institution. She then repeated that, "" There is no number to remove. '' and hung up on me. 

At this point I am frustrated that this company will not stop calling my work phone even though I have asked, and that they treated me as if I were the one making an error, or as if I were delinquent on a debt, or as if I had somehow otherwise offended society. So I called the number back hoping to speak to a manager. When I called back, I had the most unbelievable phone conversation of my life. I was treated as if I did not deserve to exist on this planet. 

The man that answered the phone stated that his name was XXXX XXXX and how can he help me. I asked for a manager. From there the conversation immediately escalated. XXXX stated that I could talk to him. I asked if he was a manager. He stated that I could talk to him. He would not answer whether he was a manger. I then tried to explain what my complaint was, and he cut me off asking where I was calling from because my number does not match their system ( at this point I was on an outbound call from my employer, so the main number would show to them as opposed to my direct line which is the line that they continuously call ). I was n't even able to explain what my complaint was, or the difference in phone numbers or anything else because he was yelling at me and would n't let me speak. So I stated that I would like to know the name of their organization, at which point he hung up on me. 

I do n't have any delinquent debts. I do not deserve to be treated like this. They are in error - they call the wrong person. I have asked to be removed from their list and they continue to call. Even if I were the right person and did owe a debt, no one deserves that sort of harassment or mistreatment.

I was unaware of the extent of the fraudulent charges especially since I was using the card at the same time and my primary method of reviewing the statements was by phone and not all of the relevant information was available to me, such as the city where the charges were made. Furthermore, my bill was due and I wanted to avoid late charges and extra interest and to maintain the good standing of my account. 
I am certain this transaction is fraudulent. I had to provide an agency with the last twelve months of statements. The agency was only concerned with charges relevant to them. As I was omitting non-relevant charges I discovered a fraudulent charge in XXXX, XXXX, on a different credit card from a company I had never heard of.

The escrow sheet clearly reflects that Ocwen received the last escrow payment in XXXX 2016 and nothing in XXXX, XXXX or XXXX 2016. With this information provided, we should not be short in our escrow account because our insurance is not due until XXXX and our taxes are not due until XXXX 2016. This means, we should have more than enough funds within our escrow account to pay out taxes and insurance when they become due. Ocwen did not need to raise our monthly mortgage payments due to there mistake! If Ocwen Loan Servicing can not service this loan correctly, then we should be allowed to pay our property taxes and insurance ourselves. There is nothing with in our modification agreement nor our original loan documents that reflects that we are not allowed to make these payments on our own. Ocwen is clearly un-professional and Ocwen must allow us to pay our taxes and insurance ourselves.

Over 90 days ago I wrote each creditor in question and demanded proof that the accounts listed on my credit file contains the accurate information, such as date open, original credit limit. Documents with my signature constituting obligations that is have entered into business with them etc. I asked for proof of the alleged debt from each creditor. So fsr none of them has been sble to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted XXXX contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rrights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX v. XXXX ( MO ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt can be validated. Which leads me to wonder, hope is Experian stating accounts are "" verified '' on my credit report. The letters I receive from Experian states accounts "" verified '' but this is not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditors and asking them to match up numbers in their database is not a sufficient verification. Now I am prepared to sue Experian for being such as pain in the posterior to me. I provided more than enough proof to havr accounts in question removed.

I have always maintained my account in good standing. I paid my account down to a XXXX balance in XXXX XXXX and did not use the card to make purchases for more than a year.

When I called Target to inquire as to why my credit limit was reduced, I was informed that Target 's company policy allows them to reduce and/or close cardholders accounts after 13 months of inactivity. I was floored. I asked to receive this information in writing and was told that Target can not send me this policy that apparently is tied to my credit agreement with them in writing. Essentially, Target is penalizing cardholders for NOT using their available credit AND they are NOT informing cardholders that this is a requirement or part of their credit agreement. By reducing my credit limit from {$2700.00} to {$200.00} Target has now negatively impacted my creditworthiness and credit score with consumer reporting agencies and said that in order to keep the account open I have to purchase something on the card. This is a deceptive, very predatory and unfair business practice! How can Target be allowed to do this? I was never notified that I was in jeopardy of my credit line being reduced or the account being closed due to inactivity. I 've been a cardholder for almost 10 years and now I am being forced to incur additional debt when I do n't want to or have the account closed by Target which will significantly and negatively impact my credit score.

I was not until the promotional rate ended that I saw that all my payments were applied to a different balance. I called to dispute this and was again given incorrect information I asked for an explanations on why then I was being charged interest and upon further research that information was incorrect. That all my payments were put on the promo rate ending later because it was a cash advance. I asked again why after several calls I was not told this and I was told it was a mistake. The rep told me to go to the nearest branch and talk to a manager and they would be able to help. Talked to her and she told me to wait for her to do research. Waited for XXXX weeks she called me back and said that they were aware they made a mistake and would refund me the interest and allocate the right amounts. This did not happen when calling I was told it was a XXXX time credit and I was responsible for the remaining balance on the nearest ending promo rate. That they would not allocate my payment to this balance regardless of any previous information I was given. I do n't really know what else to do since I would have never ever made a payment that big if I knew it would not be allocated to the balance ending the soonest. The way the statement is set up I had absolutely no clue where my payments where going. I feel completely ripped off and feel cheated. I ca n't believe that so many people would give me incorrect information and find their statements be so misleading. The gave me not any other really recourses. I 'm not asking for a refund just for them to do what I was told would happen on several calls and by a branch manager. I believe that any information given to a consumer should be accurate since its money that we are talking about. I have held my end by always making my payments on time and calling to inquire when I have a question. Their only responsibility to provide accurate information.

05/12/2016,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"RE : Collection Debt with Professional Debt Mediation ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX ) in the amounts of {$2800.00} and {$500.00} Dear Sir/Madam : Yesterday I discovered that XXXX collection items were reported on my credit report on XXXX/XXXX/2010. I disputed these items stating that they could not possible belong to me. I called the collection agency and they informed me that they had documentation from your company that I had abandoned my apartment to escape eviction, did not pay rent, left the apartment in disarray among other things. Needless to say, I was shocked because absolutely none of this happened! 

On XXXX XXXX, 2010 I returned home from the holidays and found my door had been kicked in. I immediately called the onsite security while I sat in the parking lot watching my apartment. I called several times but there was never an answer. I found out later from the leasing agent that the security officer had been fired, however, none of the tenants had been notified. Since I could not contact security, I called the XXXX County Police Department. A female officer answered the call and she walked through my apartment to ensure no one was still in there. She also tried to take prints of the shoe print on the door. She waited while I called my father and my son. They arrived about twenty minutes later. 

My father and son was with me when the maintenance man came to repair the door frame. The wooden frame was destroyed and an area right above the keyhole was indented, you could see outside. The maintenance man found XXXX pieces about XXXX to XXXX inches long and nailed them back. The rest of the right side of the door ( from the inside ) was in splinters. I asked him how would it take to replace the frame and he said the complex had no obligation to replace it. The next day I talked with the leasing agent and she confirmed it. I lived right across from the leasing office and she walked with me to see the damage and she still concurred that they would be doing no further repairs on the frame. Right then I told her that I felt unsafe, feared for my life and I would be moving the same day, XXXX XXXX. She said she understood and I told her to call me to let me know if I owed for those two days or for the entire month. She said since it was only the second day, I did n't owe anything as long as I was out that day. 

I lived by myself in that apartment, I had XXXX bed, washer and dryer and a living room suite . My apartment was immaculate. Under no circumstances would I have left that apartment filthy. I never had any problems living at XXXX until the break-in. To hear that I am accused of skipping out on rent assaults my character. My rent was only about {$600.00} and I was making {$65000.00} a year. Living at XXXX afforded me the opportunity to pay for my son 's college education. A few months after moving from XXXX, I found another apartment in XXXX, paying {$1200.00} a month. No one skips out on {$600.00} rent to pay {$1200.00}. You can check my payment history and you will see XXXX never had a problem from me as a tenant. 

I would like to resolve this issue as amicably as possible. I did not skip out on rent. I do not owe {$3300.00}. The information given to PDM and the courts was false. My father and son witnessed the repairs. The current leasing agent says she is still trying to reconcile issues that remain after XXXX XXXX XXXX stopped managing the property. Please contact the collection agency and have them remove this debt from their records. Contact me at any time. Thank for your time and assistance in this matter.",,"Professional Debt Mediation, Inc.",GA,300XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/12/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1921881

But they did not send it out until around XXXX XXXX after speaking to the male supervisor it was clear that the intention was never to allow me to pay the reduced amount of XXXX. There was no date on the envelope sent by the credit company so they could and did say that the letter was sent before the closing date on the letter, and blame the postal service for the delay. The supervisor is very disagreeable and rude and seem to be counter productive to getting the companies payments from the customers. This supervisor places on my file what he choose to, after I asked him to put on my file that I am willing to accept their offer of paying XXXX but I could not afford to pay the full amount of XXXX. This debt was bought from the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Michigan. I feel that the National Credit system is deliberately misrepresentive of their offers to reduce your debt because they do n't give you time to respond to these requests and blame the postal service for being too blame for the delay when it is clear that if they had sent the letters out in a timely manner I would got it in time to respond to the offer they sent me.

The dispute and resolution happened by phone and email in my eBay account. My eBay account does not have the old emails and when I spoke with Ebay today they have no record of my dispute and resolution in 2012. Also, my account no longer shows that items fraudulently sold through my account and the seller 's information which helped prove the first time around that I was NOT the seller. So here I am three years later disputing the same fees again and can not provide the proof because eBay has deleted the information from my account.

08/04/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"This complaint is for the predatory lending by CarMax ( and it 's affiliated companies CarMax XXXX XXXX and XXXX ). 
The Lender, CarMax, sold me a bundled loan to finance the purchase of a car and an extended warranty on or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 100 % of the cost of the car, extended warranty, taxes and fees, totaled {$49000.00}, were financed. The extended warranty covers the vehicle until XXXX total miles driven or XXXX/XXXX/XXXX whichever is reached first. I originally had no intention of taking out such a big loan to purchase a XXXX vehicle notorious for expensive repairs. However, I was duped into this loan believing that the Lender will cover the repairs under it 's XXXX warranty program, but the Lender failed to perform under the terms of the loan. 
While on my way to work on the morning of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, a yellow "" warning light '' came on indicating "" coolant low '' with a message to `` drive moderately ''. I reduced driving speed, exited the freeway, and drove slowly to a XXXX certified auto shop nearby. 
The auto repair shop identified a failed water pump system and requested the claim from CarMax on my behalf. The claim was approved on that day and the repair was completed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Once the water pump system was replaced, the shop was able to start the engine and test the vehicle for safe operation. It was at this time, the diagnostic showed the engine had failed along with the water pump. It was not diagnosed earlier due to a malfunctioned water pump system. 
When the auto shop requested approval for engine repair, the Lender denied the claim. The denial reason was that the engine failure was due overheating caused by owner 's negligence. That denial was disingenuous and malicious with intend to cause harm for the following reasons : 1 ) It is unreasonable for the Lender to automatically conclude the cause of engine failure was due to owner 's negligence over the phone without diagnose the failed engine. Lender asked that the owner ( me ) to pay for the labor cost ( ~ $ XXXX {$3000.00} ) to take apart the engine to individually inspect components that may have caused the failure, then prove the damage was not caused by the owner 's negligence, before the Lender will consider the claim ( not approve the claim ). Lender has absolutely no basis or evidence for owner 's negligence yet claim was denied. 
2 ) Lender claimed engine failed due to over heating. It is impossible for lender to determine the cause of engine failure over the phone without physical inspection. The lender already conceded water pump system failure is covered under the warranty by approving that claim. Since the water pump system supplies coolant to the engine, if the engine overheated due to lack of coolant, it was caused by a failed component covered by the warranty, not by the owner 's failure to maintain adequate coolant level. Lender still has not established the cause of engine failure yet denying the claim for engine repair over the phone. 
3 ) Lender denying claim accusing owner 's negligence. There is no way a Lender can conclusively determine that the engine overheat was due to owner negligence. The vehicle the Lender sold me, 2010 BMW 650ci, is not equipped with an engine temperature gauge for the driver. There is no way to monitor whether engine is over heating other than vehicle warning lights. No warning light of any kind on engine overheating or to stop driving ever came on. In fact, the caution light that came on was for "" coolant low '' and to `` drive moderately '', which completely contradict the basis of the claim denial. 
The predatory lender is acting in bad faith in performing according to the terms of the loan.

I asked to speak to a Collections agent, and they would n't put me through since my account was not past due. Instead, the representative told me he talked to them and they ( Collections ) said they could not help me until my account was past due so that I should let it go past due if I wanted help. He told me past due means 5 days, and that after 15 days delinquent but that I would not have to worry since 30 days is when they would report me to the Credit Bureau. This is extremely bothersome. They want me to miss a payment before they will help me? How is that helpful. It puts a stain on my account. Plus, who is to say they can even help me after I miss the payment? This is a situation where I needed to find out if someone could help me or if I will need to start calling all my family and friends to see if someone could help me make my payment. I needed help today, not when I am past due. This has truly upset me as I feel like they are giving poor advice and lacking in customer care.

This took over 5 years to reach the {$300.00} mark for cash rewards and would have been 25 % more, if it was transferred into the checking account I have had since the 90 's. But they decided to change all the rules and XXXX people out of {$45.00} of the money originally promised for over 5 years. They decided to change it to 10 % now in XXXX 2015.

I feel like I just wasted over 5 years of my life, thinking I was soon going to get {$75.00} extra for using this card. How convenient, the average use of this card, will take the average person that long to get to {$300.00}, so they make more money off of screwing us, by changing the rules, when they see how many people are going to reach their {$300.00} goals.

01/16/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Dear Sir or Madam, Ever since XXXX XXXX XXXX sold our Mortgage Loan to XXXX, we have had nothing but problems. My husband and I back in 2009, tried to modify the loan. This was an absolute nightmare. After submitting information several times and going through numerous "" scheduling '' of calls with Loan counselors, who when I finally got to talk to them, had nothing of substance to discuss or help me with and offered no guidance or help. They would tell me that I needed to get certain pieces of info. and schedule yet another call ( which were always 2 weeks later ) and take it from there, then it was like XXXX XXXX XXXX ... .. I would schedule call after call just to discuss separate pieces of my Loan Mod. Application. It made NO SENSE! I got nowhere and gave up. I have a file 3 inches thick with my application, with forms and notes and all the back up info that I scanned to them, which they claimed to never have received ... .. I finally gave up. With my husband laid off due the construction industry being very slow at the time, I decided to file bankruptcy. I believe that had I was given the chance to modify, I could have avoided filing for Chapter XXXX. About 4 years later or so, here I am now, and the loan was sold to Nationstar. Again, I am having issues which again stem from XXXX. I have had to have my bankruptcy attorney help me to get a simple answer about why my escrows all of the sudden went up {$300.00} per month! My taxes did not go up. The only thing that I did do was switch my Homeowners Insurer and my payment should have only gone up around {$30.00} a month, or less!! XXXX sent me XXXX copies of an Escrow Analysis which was XXXX or so pages, which raised my payment upwards of {$300.00} per month, and did not offer a clear reason why. I called and was given no explanation by XXXX. As a matter of fact, I was told "" you were not supposed to see that ''. I did not know what that meant. I received a letter from XXXX after this saying my loan was transferred to NationStar. I called them for explanation and guidance, and got fuzzy answers from them. Nobody could explain the payment increase. They even told my attorney that they did not know what happened. I kind of let it go for a while, and then when I called in my payment for that month they would not take my normal payment. They would only take the payment with the increase of {$300.00}. I did not want to pay that because I did not agree with it and it is not in my budget being in Chapter XXXX, plus I was offered no reason why the payment increased! So, for the next several months I had to mail in my payments ( my normal payment NOT the payment with their increase calculations ), and my payments were late. In the meantime, I am having an attorney help me. After approximately 7 months, my attorney FINALLY got an answer ... .. my payment did increase but buy {$90.00}, not {$300.00} - however, I still do not why! I have the form and my loan number is crossed out, so I do n't even know if it is mine .... Right now, I am so confused. I have now incurred attorneys fees and late fees due to this error. I do not think I should be obligated to pay these fees due to XXXX error and Nationstar 's ignorance in its inability to explain the increase. Is there anything you can do to help me.

As they make their XXXX % on my balances, at the same time they are reporting to the credit reporting agencies that I am a risk of missing a payment and the reporting agencies have labeled me as a very poor credit card risk with a very poor utilization since I use so much money. They rate me very poor and this reflects in a lower credit score of about XXXX. With a score that low many underwriters take my application for growing my business and deny me the opportunity to borrow money to make more money. The credit card companies would like me to use not more than 15 % of the limit showing I am worthy, but then I ask what is the point of having a credit limit, especially if I can utilize that {$15000.00} limit and make those payments with no lose or risk to them. It appears the banks have it both ways in that they make a ton of money off me, get paid, never chase me for money and tell all creditors I am not worthy of any additional credit. What the banks and the credit agencies do not even consider is my mrtage payments monthly are about {$9000.00} a month and I have not been late in the past five years with any payments. The characterization of the credit card agencies does not give an accurate profile of what I can afford in a monthly payment. If you look at the payment history of my profile, not only do I make the monthly credit card payments, the mortgages, the loans and when all monthly payments in my life are totaled they approach {$30000.00} a month. BUT, the credit reporting agencies are telling everyone that looks at my credit that I am a poor risk because I utilize my credit with the banks. Since the banks are in business to make money, and they do make money off of me, how is it fair they can also tell any creditor who looks at my profile that I am a very poor risk. This is wrong, everyone I speak with tells me this is wrong and yet in the banks and the credit agencies continue to demonize me financially and should not be allowed to do that. I can not refinance anything or borrow any money due to the erroneous profile of the banks and the erroneous profile the credit reporting agencies give me. I am livid they have the power to get away this this sham and what makes me even more angrier that no bank will answer my concerns and credit reporting agencies use the rhetoric of "" we only report what we are told ''. The XXXX agencies should be investigated by the government because XXXX out of every XXXX people will all say what they mess they make of their lives.

I did not fill out this part of XXXX since I filed form XXXX. I was told once the underwriter received the amended return the loan would be approved.

I said this for the reason that when you file form XXXX, you do not fill out XXXX ; you do not do both, it is one or the other. The realtor told me it would be great if I could get that in writing where she could submit the letter to the underwriter. So, I contacted XXXX attorneys ( XXXX being a tax attorney, XXXX being a real estate attorney ) who confirmed that when you file form XXXX, XXXX should not be filled out. The underwriter was wrong, and the attorney did write a letter to this effect that I submitted to the realtor, who submitted it to the underwriter, and some more people involved she told me. In the meanwhile, the realtor informed me that when a decision is not made in 30 days, what she could do is withdraw the loan until I either amend the return or produce the letter. The loan was neither approved or denied at this point. To my surprise, I received papers in the mail indicating I had withdrawn the loan, and in terminology as if the loan had been denied.

05/22/2016,Credit card,,Transaction issue,,"To whom it may concern, On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I setup a one time on line payment of {$300.00} to make a payment on my credit card which is a Wells Fargo card. The payment was scheduled for XXXX/XXXX/2016 with a due date of XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I logged into my account XXXX/XXXX/2016 to confirm the transaction and noticed Well Fargo withdraw {$600.00} from my checking account. Transactions XXXX and XXXX. 
I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and was told Wells Fargo can not do anything until the transactions post and that I should call XXXX/XXXX/2016 to receive my {$300.00}. 
I asked how did this happen to which she replied, I do n't know, but can see that I setup just XXXX {$300.00} transaction. The horror began when I called back on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I was told by a manager, XXXX, I believe her name to be. I was told XXXX transaction will be reversed, but will have to wait up to10 business days for my funds to be returned to my XXXX bank account. Without any doubt in my mind had the bank inadvertently given me {$300.00} the funds would have been immediately withdrawn from my account that day. 
I explained I need the money to pay electric, water, phone, insurances bills etc. etc. XXXX reply was there is NO other option she could afford me and that I have to wait. That alone is atrocious. Being a husband and father of XXXX children, the cash was truly needed. With today 's technology I 'm sure the money could have been returned immediately. Or perhaps all banks work in this fashion, I do n't know. 
Essentially, Wells Fargo, in my opinion stole {$300.00} from my banking account without my permission, have no reasonable explanation as to how it happen and I have no option but to wait up to 10 days for my money. 
I placed my trust in Wells Fargo and was deceived as they basically turned around and as I feel stole from my account and forced XXXX option down my throat, wait for your money. 
Wells Fargo blatantly took my {$300.00} from my account and I 'm forced to wait up to ten days for Wells Fargo to return my money. I guess you can call it a small loan. If Wells Fargo did this to XXXX people over a ten day span which is easy to do, for I 'm proof of that, that would amount to a small loan of {>= $1,000,000}. Imagine what you could do with that amount of money of a 10 day period. 
I believe this practice is unscrupulous and turns innocent people such as myself into victims. 
Under no circumstances should this have ever happened and to hear Wells Fargo explain they have no reasonable explanation is absurd. 
I 'm writing this letter asking the banking committee to investigate this matter and put an end to this ridiculous practice.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Wells Fargo & Company,NJ,070XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/22/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1936219

When purchasing my home in XX/XX/XXXX, I established an escrow impound account at closing to pay property taxes and insurance. ( Including supplemental taxes that had been determined due to property re-evaluation and inheritance ownership changes ). 

XX/XX/XXXX Chase refunded me {$4800.00} from my escrow account. But there was an outstanding supplemental property tax due on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of $ XXXXXXXXI made many unsuccessful phone calls to Chase customer service, waiting on hold for an XXXX on XXXX attempt. When I received a "" Notice of Delinquency '' from the XXXX XXXX Tax Collector, I resorted to email. 

In response to my insistence, ( several phone calls and XXXX emails ) the supplemental tax was finally paid, LATE, on XX/XX/XXXX. A {$320.00} late payment penalty was incurred. 

XX/XX/XXXX Chase mailed a letter saying an escrow analysis would occur and I should look on Chase.com to see if my monthly payment would increase. I checked and was informed I could repay my escrow account {$3100.00} by XX/XX/XXXX or my monthly payment would increase. 

I arranged a meeting with my escrow account manager. We called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX. We spent XXXX hours on the phone, finally XXXX XXXX a Chase Tax Supervisor agreed that Chase had made a mistake, and would pay the {$320.00} late payment penalty. 

The next week I got a call from XXXX XXXX in the Chase Tax Escalation department, he asked to review my Property Tax Escrow account. He acted as if he had no idea why I had contacted chase in the first place, a month ago. I referenced XXXX, but he said she had no authority. After about XXXX more phone calls, we arranged to speak with my escrow account manager again on XXXX. I feared he was twisting things around that had already been resolved. 

In the meantime I wanted to pay back the escrow funds that they had mistakenly refunded to me in XXXX, so my monthly payment would not increase. 

XX/XX/XXXX My XXXX mortgage payment was automatically deducted from my checking account as normal. In a separate transaction, I went on-line and made a XXXX payment into my escrow account in the amount of {$3100.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX I checked my checking account and realized that Chase had deducted not only my XXXX payment, but also deducted the XXXX payment when they deducted the escrow amount. My checking account was wiped out. I called Chase immediately and was told they would wire the XXXX payment back into my checking account by next Tuesday. 

XX/XX/XXXX meeting with my escrow agent and XXXX XXXX ( on the phone ). He was rude, condescending and said Chase refused to accept any responsibility for paying supplemental taxes, the late penalty was my responsibility. 

XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX from the Escrow Research Department at Chase. Apparently the man who told me that "" the payment would be wired back into my account by next Tuesday '' did n't know what he was talking about, so the issue had been escalated to her. She said that Chase could not wire funds into my checking account, because I have a "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' checking account, not Chase. It would take longer because she needed to look into it and "" process '' the request. 

XXXX The XXXX time escrow payment, and the XXXX mortgage payment were deposited back in my account. I have since received many voice mails and an email from XXXX to let me know that the funds were returned, but reminding me that I still need to make the payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX I repaid the escrow from my checking into my Chase escrow account, and paid the late fee penalty to the XXXX XXXX property tax department

The resolution provided are by far true. 
Conversations with the rep have clearly stated there were errors made with my title and that they have filed a claim with the title company. they had indicated they were investigating only to send me a letter stating they answered the complaint in XXXX. 
I have furnished them with a XXXX page complete title report in which there were XXXX liens prior to my modifcation and insist it was an error by XXXX XXXX. Sadly we know that not to be true that a complete title was not ordered by Wells Fargo, if it was, the facts would be there. They stated they showed a judgement when i completed the modification which we all know judgement 's do not show on title. The lack of purpose or meaning to the people at Wells handling this case is totally unexceptable. 
They claim to have people working on this issue in different departments but there is no true resolution since they cant admit the errors they made. 
I also had advised the rep of calls from there people in title calling and yelling at me telling me 6 months later that i had to resign a duplicate mortgage because of mistakes made, and there response is they spoke to me acceptable. Acceptable and no explanation on a duplicate mortgage?? Yelling at homeowers is still acceptable by Wells? 
I asked recently about a principle reduction that XXXX XXXX is offering and i was told i was n't entitled since i was n't behind in my mortgage in XXXX. XXXX XXXX rolled this program out prior to XXXX, and with just receiving the appraisal on my home 2 years later showing my property was worth XXXX in 2014 and a modification was given to me for XXXX?????? who does these things.

Does anyone care?

I carefully read the terms outlined in the letter for the process of using a Chase Slate check as payment to the provider of services. First, the check must post to my account by XXXX/XXXX/2016 ; the date was XXXX/XXXX/2016, so I saw no problem with this. Second, the balance transfer check written can not exceed {$15000.00} ; the amount of the check was for less than that and did not exceed my available credit. And third, only a check issued by Chase Slate is valid, a copy or reproduction of the original check will not be honored. I was good to go ; upon completion of their work on XXXX/XXXX/16, I wrote them a check, using a Chase Slate balance transfer check. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I received a call from the local company who did my home repair. He said my check bounced and he also incurred bank fees.I told him to redeposit the check ; I would call Chase and get it straightened out. I obtained a copy of the returned check from our local bank and contacted Chase. After speaking with XXXX different customer service reps, they all told me the check had never hit my account on their end. Well it had to because it was returned. They took the pertinent info so it would not happen again, since it was redeposited. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received another phone call from local company saying my check bounced again and there were additional bank fees. At this point I turned to family to secure the funds needed ; I was humiliated enough at this point. I called Chase again, speaking with XXXX more reps. They claimed the check still had n't hit my account on their end. Really?? Then where is it going? This time the reps verified that the check I used was not bogus. Everything matched up, so she assured me it was legitimate. She also suggest I write a complaint to Chase about the situation and gave me the address for correspondence. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I sent my complaint to Chase. I noted that I needed to hear from them within 2 weeks of the date on the letter or I would file an official complaint ; I included my cell number. I sent that letter 16 days ago and have had no contact from Chase regarding my complaint. I did however receive an email survey pertaining to my phone calls.

01/14/2016,Credit card,,Bankruptcy,,"I am writing to you because I have no other alternative. I can not stand for my rights to continue being violated by Discover Bank. 

The root of the situation is that Discover Bank is reporting my credit card opened on XXXX XXXX, 2011 as Status - Account included in Bankruptcy. THIS ACCOUNT WAS NEVER INCLUDED IN BANKRUPTCY. 

The Chapter XXXX bankruptcy that I filed was a business bankruptcy and the discharge did not include any of my personal accounts. 

The credit bureaus keep telling me that they ca n't change the "" Status - Included in Bankruptcy '' tag, because they say that it was reported to them by Discover Bank. 

I have provided documentation to Discover for over a year, just to fall on deaf ears and not have any of my calls returned. 

Discover has treated me like a second class citizen and has completely disrespected me at every turn. Because of this experience, I feel like I have been maliciously violated and deeply wounded by Discover. 

Having this mortgage incorrectly say that it was included in bankruptcy is stopping me from getting a small business loan needed for my business to operate. This is like pouring salt into the wound. 

I am begging you to demand that Discover Bank send me a letter of apology for these violations of my Civil Rights. 

Additionally, please have them immediately remove any reference to Status - "" Included in bankruptcy '' from my consumer credit files with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX credit bureaus. 

Thank you VERY much for existing to help the "" little guy '' in this world. I very much wish that there were more of you.

I believe I am a victim and the bank is guilty of improper handling of my account and it is more of a financial incentive for them to foreclose at this time versus modifying the account and allowing me to remain in the home and make an affordable payment. I have done everything I know to do asked what income will allow me to stay in the home to get additional income and they have refused.

Now, six months later XXXX agency in XXXX sent me to collection and asking for a debt amount of {$920.00} for E & O charges I did not pay to the agency simply because I sold XXXX policy and made commission and they also made money on the policy too. But they do n't want to honor my E & O certificate. I tried reached out XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and General Mgr XXXX XXXX by emails and even office visit to resolve this issue.

So I requested them to send me a copies of E & O which XXXX agency paid in my absence of terminating their contract. It took the collection agency about three months to provide me copies. When I received those copies and reviewed it, I found out that they even have cheap liability coverage compare to what I have originally. So I asked XXXX and his representative XXXX XXXX ; why XXXX lied to me that they need XXXX liability coverage?

First of all, I do not understand what it means by "" misusing '' points, as I have never used any single point in my account. Second of all, I am not exactly sure why American Express thought it was a good idea to post my bonus point 3 months ago ( which obviously indicated that I had met all of the requirements ) only to take back all of those points today. This is misleading to customers, and I think that American Express is doing this on purpose in order to bait customers into using their cards without having to give them any points. If some of my purchases were not qualified, then why would the bonus points got posted? If I had known that some of my purchases were not qualified, then I would have used my card more in order to meet the minimum spending requirement.

I activated an auto pay option that on XXXX of every month the amount should get deducted from my checking account. XX/XX/2016, instead of XX/XX/XXXX they deducted it on XXXX XXXX 2016 because of which it got returned as funds were not sufficient. When I called the customer care they confirmed that it was purely technical error and they will represent it as per auto pay date. Surprisingly they represented it again on XXXX XXXX however I had funds so the transaction was completed. 

Now comes the bigger shock for me, as they deducted USD XXXX without informing me from account on XXXX XXXX 2016. When I called the customer care, they tell me that they had sent a cheque of the same amount to me. I did not receive any cheque till date. I never understood as to why a cheque is sent when I have n't asked for it. I had to ask them to reverse it as I was managing my credit score well and this heavy outstanding will hit it badly. They out rightly said they will not do it. I had to speak to one of the supervisor about this and she said she will raise a case but it may take 3 to 5 days. When I tried to confirm the date, she says it may happen and so please keep checking your account and inform us.. So by end of the month my statement will show higher outstanding for the amount that I have not used, impacting on my credit score.

I have XXXX Student Loans XXXX (Account XXXX). Equifax is reporting that I have XXXX loans. A few weeks ago they were reporting that I have XXXX student loans, so I disputed the XXXX loans opened in XX/XX/XXXX. Equifax did not remove them, despite the fact that I provided them my Loan Verification letter XXXX. Equifax instead, listed those XX/XX/XXXX loans again, making my credit report now show that I have XXXX student loans. This brought my score down. My credit report by Equifax, is showing that I have XXXX unsubsidized student loans opened XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX loans having a balance of $XXXX (adding $XXXX of debt to my credit report). They are also showing that I have XXXX subsidized loans opened XX/XX/XXXX, with these XXXX loans having balances of $XXXX each, (adding an additional $XXXX of debt to my report). Not only are these accounts showing up multiple times increasing my debt amount, but they all have a note saying I missed a payment. So my credit report shows derogatory remarks for all XXXX of these accounts and notes that I missed a payment when I don't even have these accounts. The XXXX loans that I actually do have XXXX are also being reported by Equifax; they are being reported correctly on my report and were opened XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. When I XXXX disputed the information with Equifax, they did not send me an email confirmation of my dispute. A week later I tried to check the dispute online and was not able to. A message came up telling me to send a copy of my Driver's License to them. I did that with the dispute form as requested. I still did not receive the confirmation number for my dispute. Instead, when I went online to check my credit report, they had XXXX more loans added to my credit report, with notes saying, ""Consumer disputes items."" I was also not able to check my dispute online. I called XXXX about the issue and they told me there is no reason Equifax should have seven loan showing on my report. They told me that as long as I send them the Verification Letter which they provided to me, the error should have been corrected. It was not. I am trying to improve my credit score to get pre-qualified for a home mortgage. Lenders heavily rely on the information reported by the XXXX major credit bureaus in order to determine if a person qualifies for a loan. That is why the information should be accurate and up-to-date. Equifax is causing me extreme stress right now by reporting inaccurate information on my report, by not allowing me a way to communicate with them or check my dispute status, and by adding things to my credit report instead of fixing the problem.

09/09/2016,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"I am writing you to lodge a formal complaint against Wells Fargo about multiple overdraft fees from XXXX totaling over {$9000.00}. I am a dedicated online banker. 
Last week, my husband made a purchase on XXXX and the pay pal account was linked to my checking account unbeknownst to him. He alerted me that he made a purchase but was unsure what account it was linked. This alerted me to check my account and I was alarmed that it was overdraft by approximately {$650.00}, so I panicked and transferred from our savings account to ensure nothing else would overdraft causing more fees. I checked my account yesterday and was flabbergasted to see that I was negative approximately {$350.00}. So I did some further investigating on my account and noticed that I was getting an overdraft fee for small items as low as XXXX cents and in the month of XXXX alone I was charged about {$1000.00} in overdraft fees. At this point I called the Wells Fargo Customer Service line and spoke with a very kind representative and she said she could only refund me {$260.00} ( give or take. ) I told her that I completely understood her position but that it would not be wise for me to settle when that would still leave my account overdraft and vulnerable to more charges. She completely understood and then transferred me to another representative with more authority. Again, I was treated very professionally and with kindness. Unfortunately she said she would only be able to refund my account around {$650.00}. Please excuse the estimations as I am going by memory. I told her that was a better amount but that I felt that I had been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and the new overdraft policies that she said I had opted in? I did further investigating on my account and am so sick right now looking at the fees charged so far this year. They total over {$3000.00}. This was money that could have been used to keep my mortgage current, my student loans current and my credit cards current, but now I am in such a hole that I ca n't see the light. 

I believe there was a lot of charges accrued due to the way Wells Fargo drafted items out of my account. And it appears that in XXXX there was a change in the overdraft policies. Between XXXX and XXXX fiscal years was charged an average of XXXX overdraft fees per year and between XXXX, I have been hit with XXXX overdraft fees which averages about XXXX overdraft fees yearly affecting my bank account negatively {$290.00} per month. During XXXX to XXXX, I ran a business and was completely focused on that and neglected overseeing my bank account as needed because mainly I trusted WF and could n't possibly fathom that this was taking place and I was being taken advantage of like this. 

My complaint is about this new policy that I was placed in without my knowledge and how it has negatively impacted my life financially and emotionally. I have been seeing a XXXX due to the XXXX this has caused. 

I would like my money back.

10/28/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Hello, I have serveral problems on my credit report related to issues of mortage lenders buying from other mortgage lenders but not taking over the customer information amicably so that all ACH direct deposit was lost as well as actual physical address to send information to regarding new lender company. This is related to Green Tree taking over from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( formally XXXX ) and Ditech taking over from Green Tree. On both occasions issues caused me to go into default or have delayed payments because I did not even know the loan companies were now being taken over by another loan company. By the time I noticed my mortgage payments had not been withdrawn from my account I was late paying after spending hours and hours and hours on the phone and e mail to correct the incorrect information they had on file for me. In the case of Green Tree they were sending the new information to a work out gym in my city! The same thing occurred with XXXX taking over from XXXX XXXX. They also lost the ACH and customer information or did not ever receive it from XXXX XXXX. This also put my account into delayed payments. 

Finally after spending 2 years trying to remove these late payments on my credit report I have still not succeeded ( I spent XXXX dollars trying to get help from XXXX XXXX who send out form letters that did not help at all ) in removing these from my credit. 

To make things worse I also had to change bank accounts due to fraud so I set up all my auto payments on a regular website based account change for everything from water to electric to health insurance etc. but the ONE that did not work was Ditech of course! I received an e mail saying "" thank you, you have successfully set up your automatic withdrawal with Ditech '' but it did not work so I called and called and finally got a manager who agreed to give me her e mail. She and I exchanged e mails over the course of two weeks during which time she could not figure out why the system would not update my new routing and checking number. Finally a colleague of hers managed to do it she said and so I thought all was well! Of course it was not and I found my account was seriously overdue while I was XXXX and did not look to see if the account was being withdrawn from. When I returned I did pay in full but again I was accused of being at fault for being late on my payments. I still have not managed to get their stupid site to work to update the information but I did record the manager reading back my routing and check number to be sure she did not mess up this months payment. 

All I want to do is to have my payments on auto withdraw and not have to worry but I have spent now 2 years trying to get this off my credit report and at the same time trying to get their faulty website to upload my new data. 

I am at the end of my rope. 

Please assist me.

12/09/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"A T T E N T I O N!!! SHERIFF SALE XXXX at XXXX. 
I am writing you to explain what happened with a streamline modification that my lender says he never got. In XXXX XXXX I was given a loan mod after paying a 3 mo. Trial period. I received the new loan and sent it back to the lender in the envelope provided by the lender ( XXXX overnight envelope ). We were NOT instructed to track the envelope or anything, just sign the loan mod and send check for the first payment in provided envelope. 
This was for XXXX XXXX th deadline to send, I sent it on XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Saturday. I heard nothing from my lender ... .no letter saying they got the package. This was supposed to be mailed within 5 days of lender receiving the package. Without hearing anything, we sent the next payment on XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I thought all was fine, and then the XXXX check shows up in the mail un cashed. I imediately called my Rep at green tree lending ... XXXX XXXX And left a message for him to call me. He never called. I waited till XXXX XXXX and was ready to pay the monthly payment but decided to call again. I did NOT talk to XXXX XXXX But someone else told me that they did not receive the documents and that I was in default again. After being told to write a letter of appeal explaining my situation I was told to "" Re-Make '' any payments I was supposedly late on. My letter was denied and I was told by letter that if I could prove I sent it, they would honor it. They kept my check for ALL months I was supposedly late on, and then sent my check back to me un cashed, not deposited into a suspension fund, just back to me un cashed in XXXX of XXXX. I still have all the checks and letters sent to me. So after dealing with another sheriff sale, I had to hire a professional loan negotiator to start working on this problem. I was, after several months of sending documents, XXXX XXXX XXXX reports, and pay stubs and past taxes I was given a loan mod that doubled what the streamline loan XXXX. was. Fearing of no other recourse, and after being told that this was the last time they would do this, we had to sign the new agreement even tho we were going to pay twice the monthly amount. I am a seasonal company owner that does not work in the winter months, so I have to save money for winter bills. I planed my winter for the streamline payment of {$650.00} but after the lender changed the new Mod Loan to {$1200.00}, I was never able to catch up on the arrears I 'm facing now. In all seriousness, I am scared to death of dealing with the lender at the collection level, I do n't trust anything they say, and I certainly believe i was a victim of discrimination and predatory lending practices. As I stated in the letter head A T T E N T I O N!!! S H E R I F F S A L E O XXXX XXXX at XXXX. Is there anyway to stop the sheriff sale to continue negotiations with lender or do I need to file a lawsuit against the lender. Please help if you can Thankyou. 

Again, Sheriff sale is this Friday the XXXX at XXXX am ... .... Please help if you can, we do not want to lose the house, we just want the contract we signed and mailed in XXXX XXXX

10/12/2015,Credit card,,Delinquent account,,"I applied for a fully secured credit card through First Progress on the month of XXXX of 2015 to improve my credit scores. I 'm trying to apply for a mortgage loan in the year to come so having new credit is important to me. My boyfriend completed the credit card application for me because he has had a credit card with them for the past year and it helped his credit improve. Unfortunately I was un-aware that there was an annual fee that was due the first month of being approved for this type of credit card, besides the fact I never received any notification ( written or verbal ) indicating the annual fee was due. After a month or so of not receiving any correspondence I called First Progress and became aware of the late charge and the delinquent annual fee. At that moment I took care of the charges and paid the account completely, I asked the representative if I was going to receive a 30 day late on my credit report and the rep said no. I asked for a confirmation number and a full name, but she said that they do n't offer that. After a month or so from this conversation I pulled a copy of my credit report and I saw that First Progress had reported a 60 day late on my credit report, I called them right away and tried to resolve this issue and all they said was to send them a written dispute and they would look into this. Since that time I have spoken to several representatives and I have not been able to get this 60 day late on my report corrected or removed. I personally feel that this was not my fault and if I had known of these charges I would have taken care of them right away, like I did when I first became aware. I need your help in resolving this matter.

06/29/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"At a point we as quite a few people, were having a hard time making ends meet. I was in an accident, which took out my income and so my wife used some of our retirement money to get us over the hump. During the next cycle after that occurred my wife forgot to mention this on our tax forms and the IRS notified us that we needed to pay the money back or that they would take it. I instinctively went to the bank and withdrew all the money from the bank. At the time our mortgage holder was taking automatic payments from the bank. We notified the mortgage company of our situation and asked them to hold off on withdrawing the funds and we told them that we would mail that payment. The mortgage company did not pay any attention to us and attempted to take the payment from our bank account. When they realized that the account had been closed they contacted us to secure the payment. I went to a different bank and opened an account then I wrote the mortgage payment with a counter check and mailed it into the mortgage company. The check was cashed but the payment was not credited. We have been trying to prove that we made this payment for 6 years and all the while the mortgage company has been charging us interest on the unpaid balance. In XXXX we filed a chapter XXXX but the house was not listed in the bankruptcy. The mortgage company put us in their bankruptcy status none the less, compounding the situation with the lost payment. At this point the mortgage company will not discuss this issue with us. They will not allow us to make arrangements to pay the underage even though we have proof that we do not owe them any money. Here is a sample of the correspondence we have been engaged in.. 

During a search of the loan payment history of mortgage loan number XXXX and based on the claim that one payment was not made during XXXX, XXXX, I found that during a bank account relocation by us, an auto withdrawal payment that had been returned to you was subsequently paid by a counter check in the amount of XXXX counter check number XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX thru XXXX bank. This payment does not show up on the readout that Wells Fargo supplied to me but does show up in my banking statement as received and cashed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All sequential payments resumed without issue from that time forward to the present. 
I also note that on page XXXX of the ledger that you supplied to me, which is a reflection of this exact time period, this payment for the amount of XXXX is not listed as received and paid and on my bank records the check was cashed. The XXXX amount shows XXXX instead of XXXX, which is very strange. This counter check payment does not appear as received or paid in your system. Please review your records to confirm.. See Picture of Check & Ledger Attached. The loan was sold to Wells Fargo shortly after this transaction occured.

See XXXX Transaction Detail for account # XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX thru XXXX/XXXX/XXXX This payment was returned from auto withdrawal because we closed the XXXX XXXX account due to a tax lien.

The land is part of a subdivision and tax information wo n't be available until the next tax roll assessment. Until that assessment is complete, I pay out of pocket to the original owner of all of the parcels, my share of the taxes. What Quicken is doing however is forcing me to make Escrow payments equal to the tax of all of the parcels knowing that the amount is incorrect and significantly overstated. What I am told is that absent having the specific amount for my parcel, they can collect the amount of all of the parcels. And yes they know this is in error and acknowledge that it is in error.

My initial complaints remain valid. 

Damages Due Withholding Funds Of BorrowerSPS has reported derogatory credit information on me while holding a significant amount of funds belonging to me since the transfer of my account servicing from XXXX to SPS. These funds were held due to an error by the XXXX servicing organizations. 

I am requesting compensation for damages to my credit and compounding my ability to refinance my home. Resulting from withholding this cash. How can you report payments when you are holding funds of the borrower? I was refunded over {$5000.00} in 2015 from SPS due to this error. These funds would have offset any delinquencies. 

An investigation by SPS and communication with XXXX will reveal this. 

Uneconomic and Unethical Mortgage UnderwritingMy mortgage payment of principal and interest is less than my local property payments. A simple review will reveal that this financing is uneconomic. 

Failure to DiscloseWhen I receive my initial mortgage and modification it was not disclosed that I would pay PMI insurance. I would like this payment eased. 


Damages Due to Property Tax Escrow MismanagementI don not pay my property taxes. My properties taxes are escrowed pay SPS. 
SPS has often miss calculated the tax escrow resulting in additional derogatory credit information and tax liens. 

Uneconomic Mortgage UnderwritingMy current mortgage payment after modification is much higher than my originalMortgage PI. Again this underwriting is uneconomic. 

I have applied for a review of this modification, which has been hampered by time lags on SPS, request for up dated in formation. 

I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter or directing me to a legal agency. 


Thanks.

07/25/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I would like to submit a complaint against XXXX XXXX at First Mortgage Company in XXXX, NM. XXXX XXXX was in charge of handling my loan on the purchase of a new home. Despite our agreement that I would make a XXXX % down payment to avoid escrow and PMI, it took XXXX XXXX over 10 tries to remove the escrow fees on the loan despite my repeated corrections and warning that she was dangerously close to missing the closing deadline. 
XXXX XXXX finally informed me that their computers were unable to create the correct loan documents. She also told me that she could no longer use her email account this close to closing and had to use a colleague 's email address. This resulted in my coming to her office to sign the documents in person. This meeting occurred on XXXX XXXX. As my closing was scheduled for XXXX XXXX, this resulted in the postponement of my closing. XXXX XXXX claimed she made a mistake and misread the closing date despite my repeated reminders to her in the preceding weeks of the imminent closing deadline including my attempt to arrange a meeting with XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, which she refused. 
It was only on XXXX XXXX, when XXXX XXXX finally realized that I was to close on XXXX XXXX and that she was in default of submitting the final loan numbers to me that she agreed to a face-to-face meeting. On XXXX XXXX, in her office, when she finally produced the correct figures for my loan, she told me to pre-date my signature to XXXX XXXX, since, apparently, federal law required her to have the final numbers to me three days before I closed, and she missed that deadline. I expressed uneasiness at putting a false date on the documents, but XXXX XXXX strongly intimated that I would not receive my loan if I did not falsify the signing date. My realtor, XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX in XXXX, was witness to this event and indicated that if I did not get the loan at this late date, the seller would sue me for breach of contract. I felt greatly pressured, therefore, to sign the documents with the incorrect date indemnifying XXXX XXXX of negligence in missing the closing date deadline. 
An additional complaint arises from not receiving the escrow written policy from XXXX XXXX. On no fewer than three separate occasions during the loan application and processing, XXXX XXXX told me she could n't correct the escrow numbers on the form due to "" federal law. '' When I asked her for the citation of this law, she was suddenly able to change the forms. The final time occurred late in the afternoon on XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX flat out refused to give me the New Mexico citation stating more than a XXXX % down payment was required to waive escrow. I called XXXX and was directed to a citation requiring the lending agency to send me their escrow policy, in writing. I forwarded this citation to XXXX XXXX, who finally responded on XXXX XXXX with the actual New Mexico statute. I told XXXX XXXX, in light of this statute, that I would put XXXX % down on the loan to which she replied that "" their computers could n't do decimals '' and that I would have to put XXXX % down. She then said she turned this matter over to their legal department. 
I finally closed on this loan on XXXX XXXX, having had it postponed twice because XXXX XXXX was unable to correctly generate the final closing numbers. I ended up dealing the Title officer, XXXX XXXX, who fixed XXXX XXXX 's mistakes and got me to closing one week late. The delayed closing resulted in increased financial outlay and a marked delay of work on my home with a variety of contractors. XXXX XXXX suggested I file a complaint with your office.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"First Mortgage Company, L.L.C.",NM,871XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/25/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2028883

02/16/2016,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"After a job loss, we applied for a loan modification XX/XX/XXXX. After several months of providing the same info repeatedly, it was finally approved XX/XX/XXXX. Although all payments since then have been timely, every month since then, Ocwen notifies us that our payment is late. When they call to ask for the payment, I provide them with payment details. Then I 'm placed on hold and when the caller returns to the line, they tell me I 'm right. The payment was being held in "" SUSPENSE '' which they will remove and apply to account. This happened EVERY SINGLE MONTH except once in XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, Ocwen decided to try to withdraw my payment from my savings account even though I authorized payment through my checking. I provided proof that I had authorized checking, not savings and proof from my bank that Ocwen tried to withdraw from savings, not checking. This did not stop them from reporting the payment as being late to XXXX which has now caused me to have a drop in my credit rating. This, in turn, has caused my interest rate to be much higher on a recent car loan. I pay the upcoming month 's mortgage by the last Friday of every month. Most times, when I go on to their website, it wo n't allow me to pay the upcoming month because it 's falsely reporting the last month 's payment is late. When I speak to a rep to explain the problem, again, after they place me on hold, come back on and tell me I 'm correct, then tell me the website will be updated and will allow me to make the upcoming month 's payment. And I try again, and it fails again. SO I call them back and they want to charge me $ $ $ to accept a payment over the phone. 
I 've spoken with Ocwen reps repeatedly. Every time I 'm told they have flagged my account and that the 'suspense ' will be removed but it continues to happen every month. They 're reporting me as being late to credit bureaus which is having an adverse affect on me which is completely unwarranted. They harass us, by leaving handwritten notes on our door, repeatedly calling us at home, cell and at work. The most frustrating part is that we are NOT LATE on our payments! If there were any way to refinance with another company, we would 've done it. But we 're stuck because they 're falsely reporting our payments are late.This is the worst company I 've ever dealt with - We need help!

I TOLD HER ALSO DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT WOULD GLADLY GO AND MAKE AN ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT THAT DAY, BUT SHE STATED THERE WAS NO NEED SINCE SHE WAS REVERSING THE O/D FEES AND IT WOULD POST IMMEDIATELY. 
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THE O/D FEES WERE APPLIED TO A BILL THAT WAS PRE-AUTHORIZED ON WEDNESDAY, XXXX, AND XXXX XXXX XXXX ACH BILL THAT POSTED TO THE ACCOUNT AT XXXX XXXX.

I ASKED XXXX WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE PENDING STATUS IF IT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DEPOSIT ON THE PENDING ITEMS, BUT IF IT IS PENDING AND IT TAKES YOUR ACCOUNT IN THE NEGATIVE THERE IS A FEE ACCESSED. HER REPLY : THE PENDING STATUS IS FOR THE MERCHANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THEIR MONEY, AND TO GIVE THE MERCHANTS 3 BUSINESS DAYS TO RECONCILE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. MY RESPONSE : SO THE PENDING STATUS IS NOT FOR THE CUSTOMERS. SHE ALSO STATED THAT PRE-AUTHORIZED CHARGES WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE A FEE IF IT GOES INTO THE NEGATIVE AND ANYTHING PENDING THAT HAS NOT POSTED WILL GENERATE AN ADDITIONAL FEE.

When I logged into my account I pulled up the direct deposit tab and gave my tax prep the routing number XXXX and account number ***** -- -- XXXX. My return was accepted and sent out. My earliest date to receive my funds was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the latest was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. After contacting my tax preparer to confirm the right account information was put in that 's when I noticed after now looking on their phone app that the routing number I provided was different from what was displayed. I log back in error the website to make sure nothing changed and the information I gave to be submitted was the same. So I had XXXX routing numbers or that 's what I thought. At this time the offices were closes so I sent an email through the site 's secured inbox and waited. The next morning I just decide to call to go ahead and be sure everything was ok. I was told by the first Rep everything was fine and that my money should come in no problem. This is now the XXXX late evening still no deposit. So I login on the website again and notice my email has I reply that I sent out the day before. This rep informed me that the routing I gave was not associated with my account but the other routing number that had displayed in the app, XXXX, was correct and to call the XXXX to change my information. Now confused I call the XXXX and they inform me due to security issues they are n't allowed to change direct deposit information and that my refund was already sent to the information I provided yet my account never showed this deposit. I call the card company back and they are now very dismissive and telling me bogus stories. First the routing number was correct and associated with my account along with the new XXXX I just found out about, then the routing number was n't associated with my account and the bank would reject it and send it back but mind you the XXXX had nothing rejected on their end, and then I was told the routing number was old and was changed back in XXXX yet it was still available as my direct deposit information on their up to date website. Im furious now as I am clearly being lied to for this Rep with all these different bogus stories. I request to speak to a supervisor who o ly tells me the same thing then suggested I call the IRS again to get a trace number to track the deposit. I do so the next morning as soon as they open. The XXXX informs me no rejections on my funds were made and they do not give out tracking info on direct deposits at all. Now how could my cars company not no that. I was told to contact XXXX and FDIC for information about what I should do. I wasbtold to gibe the information to my cars company that I was told by the XXXX and demand the right to my money because this was their error giving me the wrong deposit information. I even called the bank associated with the card and gave XXXX the routing number I had. The XXXX associated with my account came up as netspend the other no information. So I was told to contact the card company to ensure that those numbers would be the numbers needed along with the correct number for my money to appear in my account. I call them back and told them everything I 've done who I spoke to and what was said and how everyone agrees the company is at fault for losing my money. Im placed on old while the rwp goes over my account just for her to come back and say once again that if the information was incorrect the XXXX would reject it but they DID N'T. She tells me now I have to wait 6 days for the XXXX to receive a rejection hat they are not going to receive because my moneywas was placed somewhere successfully but not in my account! I informed them that I would indeed file a complain. I can not and will not wait six days for nothing when everyone else 's job was done right but theirs! I want my money deposited immediately.

Sounds easy right? Guess again.

I personally used my debit card twice both to withdraw money from an ATM both for the total of {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. While traveling and while in XXXX I noticed that my card was being used in XXXX XXXX for a total of {$140.00} all unauthorized transactions. I logged into my online banking while on vacation daily to see the transactions posting, I was previously told by my bank in different occasions that I can not entered a fraud claim for transactions that have not posted. I waited until all transactions posted and cleared and called my bank to report the claim by which time I was already bank in XXXX. 
The first report was done of XXXX XXXX, 2016 Bank of America sent me a fraud statement and a letter saying my claim was received on XXXX XXXX and gave me provisional credit in the total of {$140.00}. I received two different letters on XX/XX/XXXX and later on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my provisional credit was going to be reversed, reversal of the credits happends on XX/XX/XXXX. I reentered the claim from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX in total of XXXX claims which all got denied and the money until this day has not been put back into my account. 
I have no merchandise for the {$140.00}, I did not purchase anything from XXXX and I did not traveled to XXXX in the days in question. I have been more than corporative with Bank of America regarding this issue, I have called numerous of times spoke to different people regarding this claim, received the same excused over and over. There reason for denying the claim is that "" no posting error happened ''. Last called I made on XXXX/XXXX/2016 the representative from Bank of America I spoke to provided me a more detailed information as to why my claim was denied she mentioned the following. 
1. I logged into my account online on multiple days ( I did so because I was waiting for the transactions to post as I was advised before that the transactions need to post prior to me calling and report the claim ) 2. I did not block my card in time ( I was out of the state and did not want to be without my card, I had taking cash out of the ATM to cover me for the days I was out ) 3. It took me long to file the claim ( I did not report it in time because I was waiting for ALL of the transactions to post ) 4. I did traveled to XXXX ( I did not traveled to XXXX AT ALL and I have my flight information as prove which I have mentioned I can provide them a copy ) 5. My chip card was used and nobody could had figured out my password ( I have had previous fraud on a chip card before and my password was also compromised and used with the card and that reason was never giving to me before ) This entire claim has been poorly handled by Bank of America. I never authorized the transactions, I have never travelled to XXXX AT ALL not even on the days in question, I have no merchandise for whatever was purchased and my card was in my possession the entire time. I will like this matter handled and my money back into my account for the full amount of {$140.00}. I have mentioned before that I am willing to prosecute whoever did the transactions. I should not have to go through this headache of retrieving all of this information and doing the leg work for Bank of America when I know the transactions where not authorized by me and where not done by me at all. I am very dissatisfied with the services I have received during this claim and I will be considering closing my accounts with this bank. The poor service I received is ridiculous, I have never experience a mishandling of a claim this badly. Once again I do not have any merchandise that was purchased totaling {$140.00}, I have never travelled to XXXX, I have no knowledge of the suspect and my card was in my possession the entire time.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Bank of America,MA,021XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/08/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2099762

06/17/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"XXXXCitimortgage (Citi) has abused and harassed my family for over a year and a half. XXXXCiti violated several State and Federal laws, including but not limited to RCW 31.04.027(2), RCW 31.04.027(13), RCW 31.04.290(1). XXXXCiti failed to make any reasonable attempts to rectify the situation, provide appropriate remedies for damages. In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for Homeowner's Assistance to lower my monthly mortgage payments. My request was denied on XX/XX/XXXX. A year and a half, XXXX plus written / verbal requests and notices later, Citi still refused to provide me with an accurate and updated account reflecting no Homeowner's Assistance Status. Citi has a duty and obligation, express and implied to provide every borrower with an accurate account. Accurate in every way, including but not limited to payments, account balances, tax and insurance premiums, dates of transactions, account statuses and make accurate updates to accounts in a timely manner. The breach of Citimortgage's obligation is indisputable. Citi had plenty of opportunities to cure the default but failed to do so. The harm has been done by Citi was tremendous. We're a new family XXXX my wife and I recently married, we have a XXXX year old daughter. My wife often logged onto the account / called Citi to check, we were bombarded by mail, requests and notices about the status of the alleged assistance, assignment of a new homeowner support specialist and ineligibility for a Foreclosure Prevention Treatment. Feeling secure, being protected and safe in the family home is one of the most important things for a woman in a marriage. Citi took that away from my family for no reason! Anytime a large Citi envelope arrived, XXXX my wife and daughter looked at me with tears in their eyes and asked: ""are we in trouble""? It was cruel, unsettling and intimidating. I couldn't help asking the question, is Citi here to brake up American families and disrupt lives of responsible borrowers like us? Again, we had nothing to do with Citi's Assistance, Modification, or Treatment Programs, we clearly asked Citi XXXX plus times during that XXXX months to stop the reckless solicitations! How loud and clear does it have to be for Citi? What part of the NO and STOP couldn't they understand? Taking the frequency and duration into consideration, the reckless harassment and cruel abuse of my family by Citi is evident. By late last year, early this year I had ENOUGH of my wife's and daughter's tears and MORE THAN ENOUGH of Citimortgage's harassment and abuse. I sent several demanding letters, notices to Citimortgage, XXXX specifically advising them XX/XX/XXXX that they defaulted on their mortgage servicing obligations, I asked again to properly update my account or suspend it if they need more time and until it's repaired. No further payments will be made until the correction to the account is done. No person in the United States or anywhere else in the world should be expected to apply a payment to an account that is erroneous and inaccurately maintained by a financial institution. Citi responded by penalizing us with late payments and late reporting to the credit bureaus. My requested of adjustments was denied immediately. Citi failed to provide us with the name of the examiner. Citi's improperly updated Mortgage Assistance Tool, erroneous ""coding"" / ""flagging"" and a series of clerical errors by an unjustifiable number of Citi Executives and IT staff has been acknowledged in Citi's response to our State. Many XXXX disruption of lives of perfectly responsible American families is the result! A thorough and credible investigation is a legal and moral imperative. Given the gravity of Citi's conduct described in my complaint, I ask the CFPB for a thorough investigation and to take enforcement actions against Citi.

After seeing the drop in my credit score and researching the cause, I reached out to the state XXXX and received a letter from the state XXXX stating that I never owed any money to the state XXXX, but because my XXXX was not attached the lien was attached for improper filing of taxes. I have presented this letter to the credit agencies and despite the fact that I never missed a payment or owed any money my credit score has continued to be negatively impacted by this lien.

Unfortunately, with no knowledge to us and or even given a choice as to what company was a preference, our mortgage was sold to Ocwen. Which if we were given a choice Ocwen would NOT have even been considered. Since Ocwen has had our mortgage there has been nothing but problems. Ocwen is absolutely horrible, unprofessional to their clients, unorganized and deceiving/ dishonest. I do n't care how long they have been around ( which I have no idea ), they should have no right ( s ) to hold mortgages. Thru the past several years I have had to call Ocwen due to various notifications sent to us by way of U.S. Mail by them. I eventually had to start keeping a "" ledger '' because of their incompetence in getting straight truthful answers from them. Not to mention having an extremely hard time understanding them. On numerous occasions they claimed we were late on a payment, trying to charge us a late fee, only then calling them and confronting them on the issue they would act like they are listening, then let you know they were going to put you hold, then come back and inform you there had been a technical error and all charges would be dropped. Please note that until recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) we had NEVER been late on a house payment, no matter who held our mortgage. Also we have an escrow added onto our mortgage to cover taxes and insurance, yet sometime back Ocwen sent us a notice claiming we needed to pay our taxes to keep from putting our mortgage in jeopardy. When I called them, there response was again being a technical error and reassured us that all would be taken care of. Needless to say I have had to call Ocwen on the average of XXXX to XXXX times yearly ( since they have held our mortgage ) because of their technical errors. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, Ocwen sent us a notice that we had not even made a payment for that month. I was now furious, called Ocwen not just to question where the payment was because I paid it on line with a confirmation number but I demanded something be done because I did not want there incompetence showing up on my husbands credit report!!!!!!! And AGAIN, it did show that payment was made and according to Ocwen it was either an oversight of the person registering payments and or a technical error!!! Most recently we are experiencing a major difficulty with Ocwen, more so than any other time, to the point of possibly having to lose our home of 30 years. When we asked for help and to inform them that there was no way possibly we could afford the "" new '' payment increase of {$300.00} more per month, which we were only given a 3 1/2 week notice of said increase , Ocwen has been little help, they have denied our modification that we filled out and sent back to them, they have refused to accept at least XXXX of the new payment ( which is the same full amount of payment we made for the prior month ) to show it as good faith on our part to try and keep our home and until matters could be resolved. We were assigned a representative manager with appointed dates for phone conference but have yet to speak to HIM. The most recent rep informed me, when I asked if they could possibly help us refinance, I was told "" NO '' because they do not offer that because they are a "" loan service company '' and not a mortgage company. I then asked as to why they have the rights to hold our mortgage!!!! I could go on and on as to Ocwens inabilities, and I DO have dates, names and badge numbers as to times I have had to call Ocwen. This company shows no remorse as to the hardships of their clients, in fact I DO KNOW of XXXX other couples that have ended up losing their home because of Ocwen and having similar experiences/ hardships as we are experiencing. I now pray for the day that Ocwen has to pay for their actions!!!!!!

I received no receipt not acknowledgement at the end of the 7 days they state is required to process the bank change. I in fact received no communication whatsoever.

I paid manually, using their ExpressPay system, using the same exact information that I had registered as my main bank account for autopay. I then re-filled the autobillpay form, thinking it might have been a mistake ( I would like to add that they do not, as every other company I have interacted with would do, perform a bank account validation withdraw/deposit ). Next quarter I had the same issue, except I was notified by a late payment status on my credit card. Again, I received no communication. When I contacted the company ( who was unavailable by phone ) by email, and explained that I have n't had a late payment in seven years and would like them to withdraw the late payment from my credit status, they refused, and stated without any presentable evidence that I was wrong. At no point in time did they offer any assistance in resolving the issue, nor any advice ( despite an explicit request ) for a method to confirm that the account was properly set up. Late payments aside, I do n't understand why they would seek to damage my credit instead of simply working to ensure the account is properly set up.

We do not understand why the document was not reviewed to ensure that all requirements were fulfilled. As the professional, this was XXXX 's responsibility. 

XXXX 's office consistently communicated false information to us. In a conversation with his assistant, XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, she mentioned that the smoke detectors were not a hold up. However, XXXX communicated the exact opposite to us on that same day. She also stated that XXXX had received an extension for our closing date. XXXX did not address this issue when we questioned him in a XXXX XXXX email. We did not approve an extension, nor did we ever have a conversation with XXXX 's office regarding a late closing. 

When we expressed our surprise and dissatisfaction regarding our late closing, we received an email ( dated XXXX XXXX ) suggesting that we were responsible. In that email, XXXX indicated that we provided her with documents as quickly as we could. However, there is no mention to the fact that we were often contacted for information only a few hours before close of business, making it impossible for us to fulfill that request. As such, it is clear that the delay was caused by the office 's failure to communicate within reasonable timelines, and that XXXX did not review documents to ensure that everything was in order. 

We met with XXXX at his office on XXXX XXXX. During that conversation, options for the ways in which taxes are paid were discussed. XXXX shared his recommendation of including taxes and insurance in our monthly mortgage payments. We agreed with him that this would be best. In a subsequent conversation with XXXX, it was indicated that our payments were not set up this way. We expressed our frustration because we had previously agreed on this. XXXX stated that they would fix this issue. We received the closing disclosure on XXXX XXXX and we confirmed with XXXX, in writing, that the monthly payments reflected in the document included taxes and insurance. 

When we were given escrow documents on XXXX XXXX, we were very surprised to learn that the taxes and insurance payments were not included in the monthly payment numbers XXXX had provided to us. Despite confirming to us in writing the exact opposite, we did not learn until we were handed papers to sign that the monthly payment numbers XXXX had given to us did not include the taxes and insurance. 

We will now pay approximately {$750.00} more per month than XXXX had, in writing, told us we would pay. The financial picture that XXXX provided to us was false, and the difference has a significant impact on our livelihood. 

XXXX 's delays and errors resulted in additional expenses. We were required to pay additional rent, which we did not anticipate upon entering escrow. We hired individuals to make repairs to the home, and we needed to renegotiate their start-dates. This affected their livelihood as well. Finally, we will now be required to pay approximately {$9000.00} more annually than XXXX had represented to us in writing.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,"OPES Advisors, Inc.",CA,911XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/10/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,2105044

With the help of the CFPB ( thank you! ), I did receive printed copies of my credit reports from XXXX and XXXX. 

I am the victim of major identity theft. I did place a fraud alert and security freeze on XXXX and XXXX with Equifax. Equifax kept insisting, both over the phone and by mail, that I lived in XXXX, CA ( where I lived over XXXX years ago ). I kept telling Equifax that I have lived in XXXX, CA for nearly 4 years ; I gave them my current XXXX, CA address. 

Equifax then sent me a letter, received XXXX, stating that on or about XXXX, a "" change of address '' had been processed for my account, changing my address back to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX CA XXXX. '' Equifax changed the address back to XXXX even though I had a security freeze and fraud alert on my account. 

When I protested the change of address, Equifax said that I needed a letter from my former XXXX landlord, stating that I no longer lived there. The XXXX XXXX, which owns the XXXX apartment complex, then said they could find "" no record '' of my having ever lived there. I actually lived in that apartment complex for nearly XXXX years. I did find an old driver 's license ( in an old purse ), with the XXXX address on it. I also found a copy of an old XXXX XXXX lease. The XXXX XXXX XXXX complex stated that they had a new computer system, installed in XX/XX/XXXX, and that they had no tenant records prior to XX/XX/XXXX. The assistant manager of the XXXX XXXX complex provided me with a letter that said, "" no record '' of XXXX XXXX having lived there. 

And so, I sent Equifax, via overnight mail XXXX, a copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a copy of a gas utility bill with my current XXXX, CA address, along with a photocopy of my Social Security card. I also sent Equifax a letter, once again requesting a copy of my credit report as soon as possible. I also requested that all reports and correspondence be sent to my current XXXX, CA address. 

I explained to Equifax that I am very concerned that the current tenant at "" XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX CA XXXX, '' or perhaps a prior tenant, accessed some of my mail and personal information. Who else would have changed the address back to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX? As a precaution, I re-forwarded all of my mail from the last XXXX years to my current XXXX, CA address. 

I have completed my City of XXXX Police Department Identity Theft Affidavit, and will be meeting with them this week. I also will send a copy to the XXXX of XXXX Police Department. 

This has all been exhausting, and frustrating. In addition, I am taking care of my mom, who has XXXX XXXX. Any assistance from the CFPB would be greatly appreciated.

At that time I demanded that the account be closed immediately and was assured by the branch manager on site and the attending teller that this was the case. 
Post closing of the account I am being advised by TD Bank that there are charges against this account pertaining to the US-XXXX exchange differential. This check was deposited on XXXX XXXX 2016 in the amount of XXXX. 
This deposit was made, as I have always understood to be done, with and exchange rate differentials being applied at the time of deposit otherwise the transient exchange rate would not be applicable do to the variance over the deposit process interval. 
I believe this to be a clear demonstration of the gross incompetence of the this branch and possibly TD Bank in general. 
I spoke at length with the TD Bank Overdraft Collections Department ( XXXX ) who advised me that the problem originates with the TD Bank branch I dealt with and that resolution attempts must be directed to this branch. I withdrew all funds and closed my TD Bank account because of the incompetency of the people in that branch and the failure of their administration to recognize the problem. As such I see no reason to believe the people at this branch are any more competent now than they were XXXX/2016 when I closed the account and contacting them would be futile. 
For what it is worth the exchange rate on the day of deposit was approximately XXXX US/XXXX. . This is not accurately represented by the {$2400.00} depicted in the statement again providing an indication of the incompetency of this institution. 
It is and always has been my understanding that when an account is closed it is no longer subject to any further transactions.

03/10/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"In roughly XXXX I was having problems making the increased payment amount of my private student loan serviced by American Education Services. I contacted them on multiple occassions to request assistance to modify my loan so that I could manage the payment. I was repeatedly told I had exhausted all options. So even though I was making payments, I was not making the "" increased payment '' and would get charged late fees. At this point I accrued about {$800.00} is late charges even though I was consistent on my payments. 
I contacted a debt counseling services in late XXXX. They have been making payments to American Education Services since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The payment is paid automatically at the same time each month. I have personally managed to pay off the late charges and bring my account current. I made that payment in XXXX of this year. So I was feeling confident, and getting things handled. 
American Education Services has STILL emailed/called me in XXXX of this year saying that my payment has not been received. I emailed them the check number and date it cleared thier account. Now again for my XXXX payment, they email me AGAIN to tell me this check has not been received. So AGAIN I contact the debt consolidation company and they provide me the the check number and the date it cleared the American Education Services bank. So American Education Services is infact recieveing my payments and not applying them correctly. Two months in a row. 
Today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, after I have already emailed them with the check information AND a list showing ALL payments made since XXXX - they now want front and back copies of the check they say they do not have- but that cleared thier bank account. 
They have been getting these payments from the same source since XXXX and now all of the sudden, since I managed to pay off the late fees they say I accrued, I am yet late AGAIN?? 
How many months during the last almost 2 years have they been "" misplacing '' my payments and charging me these late fees, and then telling me they can not help me or offer me any alternatives even when I have been consistent on my payments? I sense very unethical business practices. Nothing new with the payments has occured, but now I am late - yet again - at least until they "" find '' my payment, that they already have. 
I would like an investigation into this matter and any assitance you can provide. Perhaps being able to change lenders? Are there any new reform acts for students loans that I qualify for? I am TRYING to pay my debts. I am not asking that they be wiped out, but I think I am the victim of very unfair business practices.

I switched to a credit union and thought I had closed all my US Bank accounts. I had transferred last {$30.00} out of the business and put in personal since I rarely used the business. Unbeknownst to me, an automatic debit came out of the business account for {$21.00} from XXXX a month or so after I thought I closed it. I was never notified by USBank of overdraft. They proceeded to charge initial {$36.00} overdraft fee and {$25.00} overdraft on a weekly basis for 6 more weeks and then closed the account with another {$30.00} charge. This {$21.00} overdraft then turned into {$230.00}. I had not moved or changed address, phone or email, but never received notice of this overdraft and fees. Given it was closed quickly after it occurred and they wrote it off, it just sat on my record until I finally went to open a new checking account when I recently moved. I worked and banked XXXX since that overdraft occurred. I attempted to resolve with US Bank, but was advised to go to XXXX which sent me a report but now referred me here. I am not disputing the initial overdraft and perhaps the initial fee, but a few hundred dollars of fees piled on in six weeks without attempts to reach me are bit rediculous. I am not sure how to proceed at this point. I am not stuck with getting a special restricted bank account because of this item on my XXXX report which does not tell the whole story. I can not seem to get any help with US Bank to resolve since it is now written off. I would like to negotiate a lower amount to resolve it, but can not seem to get anyone to help me.

06/23/2016,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"When my repayment obligation began after graduating, I selected a graduated repayment plan offered to me by my student loan servicer, Navient. In addition to the graduated repayment plan, I was offered a reduced interest rate on my loans if I agreed to make my payments via auto-debit each month. I agreed to this feature to take advantage of the advantageous interest rate. Since the repayment period began, all payments have been made on time. 

I recently paid submitted an electronic payment in addition to my monthly auto-debited payment, which was applied toward the principal balance of one of my outstanding loans. Due to this surplus payment, that loan was paid in full. At the time I made the payment, I was permitted to select whether I wished to have my due date advanced. The options presented to me were inapplicable because I paid the loan in full. As such, I called Navient and requested to have my future payments allocated in a particular manner. I was informed that I was not permitted to allocate my payments as I wished and that payments would be allocated according to Navient 's policy, which had the effect of applying future surplus payments to the principal balance of all my loans, pro rata, rather than to the principal balance of the highest interest loan, as I requested. A supervisor confirmed this to me. 

Shortly thereafter, I sent a letter to Navient via fax and U.S. Mail explaining, in detail, how I wished for my payments to be applied. Rather than acknowledging my correspondence, Navient provided me with a form letter setting forth its repayment policies, which is entirely unresponsive to my inquiry. As such, I followed up with a second letter, sent to Navient via fax and U.S. Mail, again requesting that my payments be applied in a particular manner. This letter has gone unanswered, and as of my most recent payment, Navient as has failed to allocate my payments as directed. 

Despite requesting written confirmation of whether my payment allocation request could be accommodated, I have not received any communication from Navient. I have reviewed all relevant promissory notes, and believe that I am permitted to make excess payments on any loan of my choosing, and so long as my loans are current-which they are-I am permitted to apply such surplus funds as I wish. I have not located any Navient policy that would supersede the terms of the promissory notes, nor have I found any federal regulation permitting Navient to dictate the manner in which I may pay off my debt obligations. 

That said, I suspect that part of the issue may be due to the auto-debit feature I enrolled in when my re-payment obligation commenced. As noted above, I agreed to auto-debit payments to take advantage of the interest rate reduction I was promised for doing so. When presented with the offer, it was not adequately disclosed that enrolling in auto-debit would prevent me from directing how payments, which were made in addition to my monthly minimum payment, can be allocated to my several loans. 

If this is indeed the reason for Navient 's noncompliance with my request, it is a borderline deceptive practice. Borrowers are induced to enter the auto-debit program with the promise of a minuscule interest rate reduction. Auto-debit also reduces the cost of postage, as well as the time and effort needed to manually submit a payment each month. In my case, the promised interest rate reduction will actually increase the amount of my total repayment obligation, because Navient 's practices are preventing me from making additional payments to the principle balance of certain loans. 

Auto-debit is a feature offered by nearly every financial institution today, and the feature is typically offered without limitations or caveats. Borrowers should be permitted to specify the amount and allocation of their auto-debited payments.",,"Navient Solutions, Inc.",FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/23/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1980481

04/27/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"Hello. Please note that the contents of this complaint is same as previous. I was advised to resubmit for each of the XXXX major credit reporting agencies. This is for EquifaxXXXX 's processed a payment late, and added a late fee. Then they never notified the customer and reported it to the credit bureau. Hello. I 'm writing because of an unsuccessful dispute regarding a late payment that was sent to collections by XXXX XXXX, before I was contacted for payment. To start, I opened up a XXXX XXXX account sometime last year and have never been late on any payment. I buy and pay off the balance right away. I never received any mail or email regarding balances, and since I have been paying it off as soon as possible, I never expect there to be a balance. On XXXX XXXX I made a payment to XXXX online and paid it in full. Since it took them XXXX days to process it, they tacked on a XXXX late fee, that I was not aware. From the time I made the payment, I thought that my balance was XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX XXXX ( for the XXXX time ) and was asked for payment and told that late fees had accumulated from the original XXXX. They removed the late fee after we discussed that I had made the payment on time and did n't know a late fee was added due time processing delay. I paid in full as I also had made other purchases and decided to just balance my account as I usually do. Later I found out that XXXX XXXX already sent it collections. Collections never contacted me, in fact XXXX XXXX contacted me and I paid them. I was fairly upset to find out that the late fee was tacked on when I paid on time, and I was never notified by phone, email, or mail regarding the bill sent to collections. Even more, I find out that before I was given an opportunity to pay, collections sent the record to the credit bureau. All this was done so fast, with no knowledge or attempt to contact me regarding a late fee on a bill that was paid on time. I tried to dispute with XXXX XXXX but after they got the payment, plus additional to XXXX my balance, they were unwilling to listen or help. I asked them why they waited to contact me after the issue was sent to collections ( nevertheless, sent to credit bureau too ) their response was that there are too many customers to contact when they are late on payments. But, since they did contact me, they could 've done so sooner so I can be made aware of an old late fee that I could 've easily paid. They argued that it was my job to check my online account information, even though I signed up for paper and email statements. I would agree if I ever received either XXXX. I investigated why I was n't receiving any mail regarding collections or statements, and I saw that they were sending my paper bills to the wrong address ( seen on my online account ). I called and opted out of paper statements since damage was done and my information was sent to the wrong address. Before this experience, I had a credit score of XXXX, which I had to work hard to achieve. This XXXX, XXXX $ late fee which increase for XXXX months, despite paying the original balance on time, dropped my credit to XXXX. XXXX XXXX credit is my least used and I payoff up to XXXX a month on my XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX card, with never XXXX late payment sent to collections or any discrepancies. I feel that I was treated unfairly and my banker had advised me to contact the credit bureau to help resolve this issue, because XXXX XXXX is habitual for treating customers in this fashion. They do n't offer any customer service or give customers a fair chance to pay their bills on time. I was also advised to notify the BBB, for which I plan on doing as well in efforts to help resolve this issue and raise awareness.

03/01/2016,Debt collection,Credit card,Disclosure verification of debt,Not given enough info to verify debt,"I 've received a letter from Midland Credit Management regarding a payment offer, which is dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Prior to this, I was unaware of any collections lodged against me by Midland Credit Management until I received this letter. I then ordered copies of my credit reports and noticed that Midland Credit Management has an account on each credit bureau 's report and the information contained within each report concerning Midland Credit Management varies from bureau to bureau and therefore, is inaccurate. 

On the XXXX report, the 'original lender ' is reported as Midland Funding Llc and the 'date assigned ' is listed as XXXX, XXXX. However, this is inconsistent with the XXXX and XXXX credit agencies ' reports which lists XXXX as the 'original lender ' with a 'date assigned ' as XXXX, XXXX. The account number is omitted from the XXXX report and the account number is encrypted in XXXX and XXXX reports. 
I have never personally opened an account with Midland Credit Management, nor have I ever accepted any extension of credit from Midland Credit Management, and I have never done any business whatsoever with this company. 

By reporting to the credit bureaus as the 'original lender ', Midland Credit Management is in violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FCDPA ), and my rights as a consumer, to fair and accurate information furnished to the credit bureaus, which is then reported to my credit file and contained within my credit report. Further, Midland Funding listing itself as the 'original lender ' on my credit reports is a misrepresentation of the facts, as it is not the 'original lender ', but a debt collection agency. According to the FCDPA, "" the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt '' is abusive and is prohibited by debt collectors such as Midland Credit Management, Midland Funding, et al., that lurk as original lenders or original creditors.

08/12/2016,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"My loans were recently transfered to Navient, sometime in early XXXX, from XXXX. From XXXX, to present, my health has been poor and my wealth/income even poorer. As such, I have qualified for IBR-repayment plans of {$0.00} per month for several years now, and with my previous servicer XXXX, submitting IBR paperwork usually required a single phone call and a single email. After I learned the procedure, it took only one yearly email with IBR application and tax return attached. I never had to worry that it would n't be processed correctly or approved or whatever. 

But with Navient this summer, it has been a root canal to try to push my IBR through inch-by-inch. I 've called customer service many times, always diligently asking if there anything more I NEED to do, is there anything more I CAN do, is there something I am doing wrong? The reason I would ask all those questions is Navient never seemed able to know how to process an IBR or sometimes even what an IBR is. This echoes the complaints of the states attorneys general, so I know that I am not alone. I 'm sorry that I did not take detailed notes of all the phones calls and how much time I spent on the phone ( nor how much this cost me as I pay for phone service on a minute-by-minute basis ) but I had no idea how painful this would be when I started. I estimate I have spent 5+ hours on the phone, and another 3-4 hours on the Internet trying to ensure that my IBR would be processed, and it still feels a bit unfinished. 

In addition to profound ignorance of IBR plans, they also have special tricks. Finally my IBR was seemingly completed this week, but even after it was done, Navient 's last trick was to conjure a late fee (! ) that was due to be paid on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This late fee was allegedly assessed by my previous servicer back in XXXX and XXXX. When I explained that I had months and months and months of emails from XXXX between XXXX and the present that stated that my balance was XXXX, Navient was not capable of receiving those emails, nor were they interested in receiving them, telling me that would have no bearing on their opinion. After I escalated my call with the customer service agents to XXXX XXXX ( this took 45 minutes talking and on hold before an agent told me I could hang up and they would call me back, which they did ). FInally by agent on level XXXX I was promised that a XXXX days process would review my complaint and the agent would REQUEST that the fees be forgiven "" as a courtesy. '' Patronization in that aside, this is just another thing for me to put in my date book and double check later to ensure resolution has been reached correctly and if I lose track of time I 'm sure I will get another late fee on XXXX XXXX when that payment is due -- an additional late fee for not paying a fraudulent late fee! 

Thanks for your time. I 'm trying to keep my head above water until Navient is finally shut down by the federal government. This is a fraudulent organization.

10/06/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My problem with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage started after I filed bankruptcy to save another property I own in a different state. I have XXXX loans with Wells Fargo and was having problems with the mortgage on a property I own in XXXX, CA. My bankruptcy was filed in XXXX. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage stating that I was to send my mortgage payments to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX. I began making the payments to this address. My bankruptcy was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that there was un-applied funds in the amount of {$2400.00}. I continued to make my payments but then I started receiving letters from Wells Fargo that I was behind in the payments.and was given an amount of over $ {$6000.00} that was delinquent. I never stopped making payments on the loan and provided Wells Fargo with copies of cashed money orders drawn on Wells Fargo Bank as evidence that I was making the payments so this amount has been in dispute. I also requested the loan be audited and received a letter XX/XX/XXXX that the inquiry was going to take longer than they expected and would be resolved by no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make payments to the XXXX XXXX IA address. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from an attorney, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX that Wells Fargo has turned my account over to foreclosure and was advised that a foreclosure was file on XXXX XXXX but no date for the foreclosure sale has been set. I am very upset about this as I feel they are now trying to take my home. I am XXXX years old and on a fixed income. I receive all kinds of letters, phone calls and people coming to my home saying they have been sent by the bank and trying to gain access to the inside of my home. I never received a resolution from Wells Fargo regarding the audit of the loan. I contacted Wells Fargo and explained to them that I had the money orders to prove I have been making payments and they told me my loan had not been paid since XX/XX/XXXX and that I owed approximately {$8400.00} in back payments, not included fees. I spoke to a gentleman named XXXX and he advised me to send in the copies of the money orders. This will be the third time I have provided them with proof that I have made the payments. At this point, I do n't have confidence or trust in Wells Fargo to follow through with what they promised and feel it is in my best interest to file this complaint. I have been trying to apply for a loan modification but was told I had too much income. That is impossible as I am on a fixed income ; I receive a small pension and social security. I also have been advised that the loan I was in was a deferred interest loan and was considered predatory. My mortgage balance is upside down with the additional interest due on the loan. Please assist me to mitigate foreclosure on my home. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

But Santander Consumer USA inflates there loans to the point it benefits them and the Dealerships who use them, both benefit at which time the Consumer 's are the big losers. 
They Bait the Consumer 's like myself with interest rates and other fees along with monthly payment amount so high that you will fail. 

I was ask if I receive public assistance which I did at the time of my loan. I feel strongly this is just one reason I received an interest rate of 28 % and a monthly payment amount of {$470.00} also I was ask why do I receive XXXX, this and my age was another reason I received an unfavorable loan interest and payment. 
I was told that GAP Insurance was added to my loan only now I am told that GAP is n't included in the loan, which means that if the vehicle is totaled Santander will come after me for any remaining amount owed. 
The extra fees and add On 's benefit Santander and the Dealerships. There are so many violations under the Truth and Lending Act on my loan. 
I was also told by Santander that they deferred one of my payment to the end of my loan, but instead they lied, I found out that they are still charging me late fees and other fees saying I am late, they are also reporting me to all of the credit bureaus as been late. which I was denied a loan because of the negative information been reported, Also my payoff should be {$17000.00} instead Santander Consumer USA told me my payoff is {$20000.00}. The loan when taken out over a year ago was for {$18000.00}. 
It 's unbelievable that Santander Consumer has so many complaints against them when I searched XXXX, I would hope that CFPB will do something about this Business. 
I feel that my age, XXXX, income, and Public Assistance has everything to do with my higher interest rate, payments and other fees, extras. 
They set me and other Consumers up for failure, get as many payments out of us as they can and than repo of vehicle.

I was contacted ( with my permission ) via phone by the sales associate who had been helping us. I was re-assured that there was no way I would be applying for a credit card "" because that HAS to be done in person, '' and that we were simply applying for the in-store credit with Conn 's.

I asked that they work with us until I was again employed and could make my payments normal again. They claimed to be looking into what they could do for us and ended up doing nothing. We ended up about 5 months behind. We made those payments and still have no idea how much extra interest we paid. While dealing with them we became aware of some mistakes on our mortgage information. We contacted Citifinancial about this and again we were given the run-around. We asked over and over for information to prove the mistakes and never received the information. We received a letter telling us, we thought, that another office would be handling our mortgage. Turns out they sold our mortgage without taking care of the issues. Now the new company has been told we did not have our payments up to date and are refusing to apply our payments until we catch up the missed payments. We are now three months behind, our mortgage balance is still not right and again are being charged extra interest. This is only the tip of the iceberg that is the problems we are having.

The Representative for Barclay Credit Card stated I can use my rewards points to pay on my balance owed. I stated I wanted to use XXXX points, Which equal to {$25.00}. The Rep for Barclay stated the {$25.00} would be applied to my minimum balance owed and I must send the remaining balance of XXXX before XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I log into Barclay Website to review my online account, which indicated Barclay Credit Card received the remaining payment of {$16.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2015. {$25.00} + $ XXXX {$41.00}. On or about XXXX XXXX,2015 I log into Barclay website and notice an alert of pass due amount of {$25.00} plus late fees. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 I contacted Barclay Credit Card Customers Service and inquired about the pass due amount. The Rep Stated I only sent in {$16.00} leaving a balance owed of {$25.00} plus late fees. I explained to the Rep I used XXXX points which is equivalent to {$25.00} plus I mailed in the remaining balance of {$16.00}, which equal a total amount of {$41.00}, the minimum balance owed. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 the Rep for Barclay Credit Card stated the XXXX points, which equal to {$25.00} are not allowed/ can not be used to pay toward minimum balance owed. I explained to the Rep I inquired/ask a Customers Service Rep on XXXX XXXX, 2015 about my rewards points and can I use them to pay on my minimum balance owed? The Rep Stated Yes and further stated the XXXX reward points= {$25.00} will be applied to the minimum balance and I must send in the remaining balance of {$16.00} before XXXX XXXX,2015. A Rep on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 stated the Representative on XXXX XXXX,2015 gave me incorrect information. I stated to the Rep on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 the information I received from the Customer Service Rep on XXXX XXXX, 2015 I relied upon and made a decision base on that information to use my rewards point toward my minimum payment owed. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 I requested the Rep to listen to the recording of the Rep and myself on XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
The Rep contacted me after inquiring about the recording of XXXX XXXX, 2015 and stated Barclay Credit Card will waive any and all late fees due to the incorrect information I received by the Customer Service Rep, but requested the {$25.00} because reward points are not allowed for payment, which I sent.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I contacted Barclay Card about the declined and the increase in my minimum balance of {$78.00}.

On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 a Barclay Customers Service Rep contacted me about the increase in the minimum amount due of {$78.00}. She stated something in regard to the increase, but it was not clear me the reason for the increase of the minimum balance. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I attempted to make a purchase at XXXX in the amount of {$20.00}, which was declined. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I contacted Barclay Customer Service about the purchase being declined. The customer service rep stated as a result of the late payment of {$25.00} these issues are present until I make a payment of about {$1.00}. The Issues are, increase in minimum amount due, no cash advance, and decline of purchases. I relied upon information from Barclay Rep, I could use my reward points to pay toward my minimum balance, as a result of the incorrect information from Barclay Rep my minimum balance owed has increased, I ca n't get cash advance, and making a purchases using my Barclay Card are being declined. 
Barclay is at fault for the incorrect info

05/27/2015,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"In XXXX my ex-fiance and I were purchasing a new home where Chase was the preferred lender that worked with the building 's sales team. During the underwriting process the onsite Chase representative asked us to provide a fraudulent lease contract for a home that I owned which we planned to lease upon moving. He said we could just get a friend to sign a lease so that underwriting would n't have to worry about that on my credit. We told him that we both have security clearances and would feel comfortable doing so, then asked to speak to the regional VP for chase to resolve the matter. The following week we met with the regional XXXX for Chase and the developer for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During the meeting both the VP for Chase and developer agreed that what our Chase representative suggested was inappropriate and the VP of Chase offered to personally ensure the loan would move forward without any further troubles. He said we may have a higher rate, but could always refinance once I 'd sold or rented the property in question. 

Roughly a year and a half later we called Chase to explore refinancing our loan. Chase told us that they could n't refinance at the time, but to follow-up again in 6 months. We called other lenders who told us that because of the type of loan that Chase had put us in, we would not be able to refinance with them. We were told that the XXXX loans that we currently had limited our options and that most likely only Chase would work with us because the loans were "" unconventional ''. 

6 months later my ex-fiance and I parted ways and called Chase back to see if XXXX or the other of us could refinance the loan and update the title at the same time. We went back and forth with Chase for 3-4 months and could never get a straight answer on how to refinance our loan and update the title. About this time we began to see the housing market really taking it 's toll on our building and decided to put the home on the market to see if we could sell it and just move on separately. Our house was listed with several agents over the course of 6 months or so and never received an offer, after several price decreases. The price was now well below what we had paid and we were beginning to worry about the financial burden, given Chases lack of response to refinance. 

In XXXX my company transferred me to XXXX and my ex-fiance had already left the XXXX area. We were forced to rent out the home at a loss and assumed we could try and refinance after financial markets settled down. I moved back to the XXXX area in late XXXX and moved back into the home to minimize our losses. My current wife was XXXX with our son in XXXX which forced us to look for a home with more than XXXX bedroom in XXXX. Again, we called Chase and asked about mortgage modifications, refinancing assistance programs, you name it ... but the answer was that we could not take advantage of any of these programs because of the loan that Chase had put us in. In XXXX my wife was laid off and my ex-fiance could no longer sustain the financial burden from this home. My ex-fiance called Chase to explore options and was told that since we were n't late on our payments that it was unlikely we would ever receive assistance. She consulted a short sale expert who said that Chase was known for this, so we stopped making payments to explore the short sale option. Chase finally started responding and we completed a short sale. Now, Chase has placed the late payments on both our credit reports after having initiated this whole problem in XXXX with their request to provide fraudulent paperwork, then exacerbated the problem by giving us advice without explaining the actions they would be taking to damage our credit. I would like to pursue an amicable solution to remove this from my credit or will be contracting with an attorney to explore legal action.

XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a letter to Credit Management , LP disputing the collections due to the fact that XXXX did not disclose that the contract was automatically extended when I moved the service from one residence to another residence. 
I received a statement XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX which reflected my account was at a zero balance. 
I recently discovered that Credit Management , LP collections had not been removed from my credit report. 
XX/XX/XXXX I sent another letter with supporting documentation requesting that the collection status be removed from my credit report. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX a representative XXXX who confirmed that I did not owe {$310.00} that 's in collections. 
XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXX at Credit Management and explained that I had confirmation in writing that the collections was not owed. XXXX insisted that the amount was still owing. I requested that the collection be removed from my credit report, and she stated that they could not remove it and that I would have to go back to XXXX and request they contact Credit Management to remove the collections. 
So I call XXXX and spoke with XXXX in the Executive Reponse Team explain to him that I had spoken with XXXX at XXXX and then with XXXX at Credit management. XXXX confirms that I do not owe the {$310.00} that is in collections. He also states that XXXX has not done business with Credit Management in years. XXXX requested that I send him a copy of my credit report so he can confirm the collections is on behalf of XXXX. 
I pulled a credit report from XXXX XXXX and faxed to him with a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and a copy of the credit report that reflected the collections. 
The credit report page I sent was page 11 out of 13 pages. Credit Management is clearly listed on the report and remarks noted on the credit report states that dispute is resolved, customer disagrees. 

When I last spoke with XXXX in XXXX, he had contacted me via phone and requested that I send him the complete credit report. I refused to do so, because I felt the information that I had sent him previously was sufficient enough. Besides, my credit report I feel is sensitive information. 
At this time, I have been getting the run around from both XXXX and Credit Management, in regards to this matter.

03/01/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"2 years ago, I started paying the loans for my wife. Since she was not paying for them, I offered to pay. However, to "" qualify '' for a forbearance program, the loan company had to speak with either my wife or my mother ( cosigner ). My wife was unreachable at the time. The representative stated that my mom had to say "" yes '' to the terms and conditions even though she does n't speak XXXX. At the time, I did n't think nothing of it and I just wanted to bring the loan current. Payments were set, from my account, automatic payments. However, the payments stopped. When I called regarding the payments, I was told that in order to continue taking payments, they needed to re-do another "" contract '' and had to speak with either my mom or my wife. My wife was not available and my mom does not speak XXXX. After many calls offering to pay, they refused to do another forbearance plan. I was told by several supervisors that they have to do it over the phone and that my mom has to speak XXXX in order to do another plan. 
This refusal has been regarding a supposed California XXXX that prohibits them from making any changes to the loan if the borrower ( my mom ) does not speak XXXX. I have called more than 5 times asking the details of this "" law '' but they have refused to tell me which XXXX is it. 
If in fact, there is a law prohibiting the loan company from making any changes to the terms and conditions due to the borrower 's lack of understanding XXXX, then, they have violated such law. 
I need to know what law is the XXXX they are referring, the specifics, so that I can file for violation of the law with the California XXXX XXXX. I feel that my mom and I, have been taken advantage of this predatory loan company. 
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

05/16/2016,Consumer Loan,Installment loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"Sometime XXXX XXXX, I secured a {$1000.00} loan from Mariner Finance in XXXX MD. In addition to the original loan, I also opted to pay for the supplemental insurance ( Unemployment ) should ( unfortunately ) this should occur. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I fell behind on 1 payment which prompted numerous and repeated phone calls to both my cell, home, and work. Each time-especially work, not to contact me here for phone calls are monitored by security. The company refused to adhere to my wishes and continued to repeatedly call my job which placed my employment in jeopardy. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I lost my job due to downsize-at least that is what I was told. Shortly thereafter, I submitted a letter to the company alerting them to the change and asked for the necessary claim form. Instead of them providing the necessary claim form for payments, Mariner Finance instead chose to allow the loan to continue to accrual interest which the loan has now near {$3000.00}. Complaints were initially filed with the XXXX and MD Dept of Labor Licensing and Regulation ( DLLR ) and had been removed from the Credit Reports. Upon a recent review of my credit report, the account now re-appears on the report dropping the score by a staggering XXXX points. As a victim of identity theft, I regularly monitor my reports for any and all suspicious activity. I am also XXXX and have been in this unfortunate predicament since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Since seeing this information reappear on the report, I have subsequently initiated another complaint with the XXXX which does n't seem to be any resolution in sight. However, by virtue of their own admission, the loan should have been paid off in XXXX. I somewhat tend to agree had they processed my claim form for which they did not. Now, after more than 2 years have passed, they are now requesting that I fill out the claim form for processing. Hence, my question : How can this be properly processed-if at all when the loss occurred in XXXX? Moreover, it is my belief that Mariner Finance is attempting to correct a mistake that simply ca n't be undone and ( purposely ) continuing to access interest on a daily basis in an effort to collect more monies that are owed-if at all due to the supplemental insurance.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Mariner Finance, LLC",MD,210XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/19/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1926132

I sought out, and got preapproved for fixed interest rate 20 year and 30 year loan terms for 3.75 %. when I made my offer I was told the condo units needed XXXX approved financing and that I would have to use their mortgage company : pinnacle Capital Mortgage XXXX. So I talked to my preapproved banks and they agreed I had to go with such a bank, and they were not approved for it. I went through pinnacle and I am upset that their interest rate was 4.25 %. So, I feel I had no choice but to pay the higher interest rate. All the terms were the same and the only reason the loan officer would state was that "" it was a condo '' so I had to pay a higher rate. I just feel this was unfair and should be reported to the proper agency to investigate. They have sold many condo units and was told they provided 90 % of the financing on them. Incidentally, my loan was sold from Pinnacle to XXXX mortgage 1 month after I closed the transaction.

09/04/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"My credit score for most of the year has been in the high XXXX 's. Last score two weeks ago XXXX. My score matters to me. I regularly monitor my report thru monitoring service with TransUnion. I initially requested that they dispute XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX items because I consigned for loans that had gotten behind but at that point, were up to date. The XXXX items I disputed were still being reported on my credit as 30 days late when that, in fact, was no longer the case. Erroneously, I thought that once the XXXX loans were reported as up to date, my score would then go up. Instead, it took a big hit ( XXXX point loss ). I tried disputing it with TransUnion but did not have any real luck. In addition, when they sent me a copy of my credit report, an old XXXX XXXX account ( closed by XXXX in XXXX but paid in full in XXXX ) was included ( along with XXXX ) under "" Adverse Accounts. '' That account ( XXXX ) had not impacted my credit report since I have been able to get credit ( more than once ) since that account was paid. I do n't understand why it would be an "" Adverse '' issue at this particular time. I feel that it was used along with XXXX to significantly bring down my credit score. I do not understand the scoring system. What I understand is that the lowest scores ( scores that equal an "" XXXX '' ) should be reserved for people who repeatedly do not pay their bills or have no interest in doing so. I pay my bills. Most of the time diligently. That is not to say that since paperless billing I do n't occasionally miss paying something on time. I have read many stories online of people like my self that are over penalized because of a scoring system that is just not what it should be. There is no grey area here, you either have a good score or it 's in the toilet. I know that if the practices of these reporting agencies were to be truly monitored, problems with how they handle the business of people 's credit would surely stand out and would show how flawed they really are. But who cares? Only the people that are victimized by their policies and practices and we of course, are not truly heard. Quite possibly, it is worth considering that the scoring system currently in place is not a fair system at all. The Consumer Affairs website contains XXXX complaints about TransUnion. Think about that. There are probably many more but most will not go online and complain. In addition to no satisfaction, when you call them ( TransUnion ), all that you are ever provided with are generic answers that neither address nor answer your questions. I am at a complete loss for what to do. I do n't need them to send me another credit report. It wo n't change anything. There is, however, something awfully wrong with the fact that you can be totally ruined by a credit score and the people responsible for ruining you do n't even have to supply you with an intelligent answer for why. My problem, I just do n't understand how, when everything that they listed as being "" Adverse '' and, was already on my report when my score was XXXX would cause my score to drop to that extent behind my asking that XXXX items be brought up to date and why an old XXXX account that has been paid for a couple of years would also play a role.

08/23/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I have had a pending issue with First Hawaiian Bank, regarding a scam that took place. In the previous complaint i filed it goes into more detail. I was given a fraudulent check in which i deposited {$2600.00} into the bank. The next day, even though the check had n't been cleared, i was allowed to withdraw half of the money. First Hawaiian Banks policies state that until the check has cleared, only {$200.00} would become available to me next day. Yet, I was able to withdraw more than stated amount. This is an excerpt from First Hawaiian Banks website on their policies for depositing checks. 

Q : What does it mean if I receive a hold on my account after I have made a deposit? 
A hold means that although we 've received your check for deposit, you wo n't be able to use the funds until the hold period has expired. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the third business day after the day of your deposit. However, the first {$200.00} of your check deposits will be available on the first business day after the date of your deposit. If the deposited item is returned unpaid before the hold expires, those funds will not be made available to you. If the deposited item is returned after the hold expired, we charge your account for the amount of the item. Holds are placed to help protect both you and us from losses that could occur when a deposited item is returned unpaid. Situations that typically cause a check to be held include : -There is reason to believe the funds may be uncollectible-The source of the check ( e.g., foreign checks ) -The account is a new account ( new account rules apply for the first 30 days the account is open ) -The account has repeated overdrafts in the last 6 months-You deposit checks totaling more than {$5000.00} on any one day-Fraud is suspected-The check was previously deposited, then returned unpaid-The check was not properly endorsedAs a XXXX year old, making her way through the tough economy that is XXXX, I never had much money in my bank account, and if First Hawaiian Bank checks their records they 'll find that previous to this transaction my account had been over drafted several times before. At the time I deposited that fraudulent check, i only had about {$3.00}. I will not pay for the negligence of First Hawaiian Bank, I should have been protected under these policies that are stated so clearly on their website for everyone to see. A hold should have been put on my account. Never had I deposited a check that big before into my account, that should have been a red flag in itself.

07/28/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"A few months ago, I had an overdraw on my checking account at PNC bank. I filed a complaint to the bank saying that I rarely overdraw and if there was any possible way I could be reimbursed for the overdraft. While I was waiting for an answer back, they added another charge on the account for the overdraft even though my complaint was not answered. Finally, an employee got back to me about my overdraft case via telephone, but the line got disconnected, and the man never called me back. From what I have gathered by contacting PNC multiple times to resolve this problem is, this man decided that the charges on my account were valid and would not give me a refund. He did not explain this to me or have the decency to call me back, and every time I tried to get this problem resolved they said there was nothing they could do because the man I spoke to already made the decision to not reinstate the funds. I was charged with over 100 dollars in banking fees because of this issue. I have called the company to complain about the issue, which the representative told me she would file a complaint about the disconnected call and how the man never called me back, but I never heard from them again. 
Furthermore, when I started the account the PNC employee that set up my account gave me the most expensive checking account, claiming it was free because I have a mortgage with them as well. When I sold the house and no longer had a mortgage through this bank, they then began charging me banking fees. I went into the branch twice to switch my account to a student checking account or a basic one, and each time they told they would, yet they never did and I was still charged the same monthly banking fee. 
I have since canceled my account because of the extremely poor customer service. I also tried to retrieve the banking statements from the month of the overdrafts, but my account login does not work now.",,PNC Bank N.A.,VA,201XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/28/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,2036492

07/19/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I enrolled in the CitiGold bank account with the promise of receiving XXXX XXXX XXXX Miles. The conditions required a {$1000.00} minimum spend and two bill pays in successive months. I met these requirements, however it took me 3 months to complete, instead of the typical 2 months because of problems with the delivery of my card and PIN. 

To elaborate, my checking card was sent by XXXX, and required that I be present for the delivery. This was not possible because the delivery attempts were made while I was at work. Despite multiple lengthy calls to both Citi and XXXX, I was unable to arrange for delivery of my card & PIN. First I was told by the Citi representative that I needed to arrange with XXXX for delivery via their online portal. I did this, but they came at the wrong time anyway. When I contacted them about it, they said that they needed to get the request directly from Citi, so I did that & they attempted at the wrong time again, then sent the card back to Citi. Meanwhile, I was locked out of my online account, had no way to monitor my credit card OR my bank account, and suffered {$100.00} in fees & interest for a late bill that I was unaware of. 

At this time, I called Citi and explained the problem, as well as my concern that the card would not arrive in time for me to make the spend within 2 months. I was assured that there were notations on my account detailing the extreme difficulty I had in simply obtaining the card. Ultimately, they re-sent the card & PIN, & I drove 20 minutes each way to the XXXX facility and received by card & PIN. I proceeded to meet the requirements in the 2 successive months after receiving my card & PIN. 

Since meeting the requirements I have been told on multiple occasions that I met the requirements, and that I simply needed to wait a designated time before the miles would be issued. After it became clear that Citi was dragging their feet on the issue, I began documenting my phone calls. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called and spoke with "" XXXX , '' who personally verified that I met the requirements, & stated that the promotion code was noted on file. He said "" I do n't know why it has been delayed, but it should be issued soon. It is probably delayed because of the billing cycle. '' He told me that XXXX miles would definitely be awarded by the end of XXXX. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called and spoke with another representative who again confirmed I met the requirements, & provided me with a reference number in case there was any other problem. She also told me that the case was being in some way prioritized, that I would receive a secure message within 72 hours & provided an access code for the message. No message was received. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16, after receiving another bill and still no response regarding the reward miles, I called yet another representative, XXXX . I stated that I had upheld my end of the bargain, but I felt like Citi had not. Further, they had not met the deadlines they set for themselves in previous conversations with me on XXXX accounts. I had been charged $ XXXX/month for having the account open while they decided if they should uphold the promise they made when I opened the account. The representative, XXXX, agreed to credit my account with {$60.00} for the last two months ' fees, as well as waive the next month 's {$30.00} fee. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received notification that Citi was denying me the miles because I had not completed the spend in the timeframe they designated. There was no mention of any of the aforementioned problems, conversations, or promises. 

My entire experience with this Citi promotion has been frustrating, time-consuming, and not worth it. They have not upheld the promises they made, they have not met the timelines they set, and finally they have not credited me with the reward they offered.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,OH,432XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/19/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2020209

For the XXXX statement period, I had paid {$700.00} less, bank statement showed that I had incurred {$37.00} in interest charges. For my XXXX statement, I had paid my open revolving balance in full again, but incurred more interest charges of {$63.00}, XXXX month in a row after having only XXXX calendar month of not completely paying the revolving balance in full once back in XXXX. Bank of America customer service dept 's service rep told me that the XXXX interest charges is a result of me walking into a banking center and making the payment and BofA taking time to process the banking center transaction, which is a bunch of baloney. With the service rep 's explanation not sounding right, we insisted on a manager, XXXX who eventually came on the call, to answer my question. He stated that the XXXX interest charge of {$63.00} was a result from a short payment back in XXXX. Okay we took that reply and we did further research and found out that not only were we charged in XXXX, but we were also charged in XXXX. We called back to the BofA credit call center and was told that the XXXX interest charges was also a result of the {$700.00} unpaid balance from XXXX. So we were charged XXXX for the same {$700.00}, given XXXX different explanations of the interest charges, and still have not resolved the issue of why there are XXXX interest charges when only once that the outstanding balance was short-paid ( short-paid balance was taken care of in the subsequent month ).

I was not aware that there were fake moneyorders and Mystery Shopping assignment was a scam or I would never had cashed these checks and so I felt like Chase Bank did n't protect me from being scammed because I never had {$1900.00} in my account and I ca n't believe that Chase is not aware of fake moneyorder and also they did n't use the 3 day waiting period that was put in place to protect unsuspecting customers like me who are clueless. If the teller had waited before giving me all the cash against my account these fake money orders would have been identified and my account would not have been placed in overdraft for the amount of {$1900.00}. Rules and Regulations are put in place to protect customers and I am disappointed in Chase for not investing in and also teaching its tellers how to identify fake moneyorder and not to cash it against customers account and them charge me all these fees every month and expect me to be paying them for not protecting me from being scammed by waiting 3 business days before cashing large amounts of money and then blaming me for this debacle and destroying my credit, when this should be placed squarely on Chase lack of following banking rules that were put in place for a reason to protect customers from this same nightmare it has being going on for too long and has destroyed my credit score. I have written XXXX letters to the bank seeking a resolution but they are saying I 'm at fault I cashed fake moneyorder and I think Chase did n't protect me from being scammed by not investing in training the tellers who should be aware and ahead of scammers and not allow them to destroy people 's finances.

I filed a complaint with the police they took the XXXX the copies of Fake Moneyorder and all information, the bank promise that FBI would be involved I would like to know if the bank was not aware of Mystery Dhopper scam like me.

Immediately after I received a mail from company 's head agent who was suppose to be my manager named XXXX XXXX stating that I need to deposit this check in to my account and after deduction of XXXX % ( e.g. XXXX/- USD ) have to send the balance money to some address in XXXX via XXXX. I forgot to tell that according to their job contract I shall be paid USD XXXX/- a month as a salary as well XXXX % of the commission of what ever the payment I collect.

While going to withdraw the balance amount ( XXXX % after deducting my so called XXXX % commission ) on next day in to the bank I came to know that the check could n't be cashed because it 's a forged one. That 's fine but additionaly the bank has close my account and debit/atm card saying that I am no more be able to use or bank with wells fargo bank not now nor in future as my banking relationship with the bank is ended because of this forged check I deposited but not cashed or withdraw. I became a victim of someone else 's forgery but I am punished by closer of my account. I spoke to bank manager personally as well to customer services and also to their fraud department. They all refused to re-activate my account saying because of this forgery your account is permanently closed and better you find some other bank to deal with not well fargo. 
My concerns and the help I seek from you are as follow ... 
1 ) Can bank close my account in such case/2 ) Can they re-activate/reopen my account considering me a victim of forgery? 
3 ) Do I be considered guilty in such case? How? Since I am not the culprit but a victim? 
4 ) Will this incident reflect bad in my back ground check? 
5 ) Will this be effect any thing adverse or bad on my credit score?

09/10/2016,Credit card,,Unsolicited issuance of credit card,,"I explicitly needed a XXXX credit card so I could use it at Costco. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I logged into the XXXX website and shopped and compared credit cards. At the XXXX website, I clicked a link to CapitalOne to apply for a CapitalOne Venture card. ( The link did not specify the type of credit card. ) I WAS NOW ON CAPITALONE 's WEBSITE. While completing the application on the CapitalOne website, I noticed that it did not specify what type of card I was applying for, so I clicked on the CapitalOne "" CHAT '' link. I asked the CaptitalOne agent what type of card this application was for and he/she replied "" XXXX, '' so I completed and submitted my application on-line. The chat agent did NOT ask me if I had been directed to their site by a 3rd party link. The application was almost immediately accepted with a very high credit limit. 
On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received XXXX MASTERCARDS in the mail. I immediately called CapitalOne and requested that they cancel these card and issue XXXX cards as their agent previously had confirmed. CapitalOne told me that because I had been directed to their site by a third party 's website ( XXXX ) they could only issue me a XXXX. I responded "" then why did n't your agent let me know this before I applied? '' Their response was basically that the chat agent had no way of knowing that I had been directed to their site via a 3rd party 's site. They refused to issue me a XXXX card and told me I could cancel the MASTECARD ( which I have now done ) but that I was now blocked from applying for a XXXX card from CapitalOne for six months. 
The reason I received a XXXX is either because of a direct lie by their agent ( which I doubt was the case ) or because of a shortcoming in CapitalOne 's website in that their Chat agent should have had the information that I had been directed to their site via a third party so he/she could have answered my question accurately. I made no errors or omissions in the process. The CapitalOne manager we talked to on the phone on XXXX/XXXX/2016 would not admit to any mistake by CapitalOne and refused to acknowledge the fact that their database/enterprise HAD to know that I had been directed to their site via a 3rd party 's site as that is why their system issued me a XXXX. Therefore, they had the information that could have been supplied to the chat agent ; however, they chose not to have that occur and the agent chose not to ask me if I had been directed to their site via a third party before answering my question incorrectly. 
Note : If I had gone directly to CapitalOne 's website without using a 3rd party link, the answer the Chat agent gave me, "" XXXX, '' would have been correct as CapitalOne 's manager told me that is the ONLY WAY to get a CaptialOne Venture XXXX card. 
Resolution requested : I would like to receive a CapitalOne Venture XXXX card with the terms and conditions for which I had originally applied. I do not want the application for this new card to appear on my credit report because multiple credit card applications in a short period of time will decrease my credit score further.",,Capital One,TX,787XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/10/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2105190

12/16/2015,Credit card,,Closing/Cancelling account,,"Barclay 's closed my wife and my credit card accounts after having a positive history of using the card, nearly never carrying a balance month to month, and having cards open for multiple years. 
At no time did we ever receive any negative feedback or notifications that Barclay had any issue with my 'history of account usage '. 
In fact, despite the 'history of account usage ' that Barclay refers to in the closing, Barclay increased the credit limit on my card and my wife 's card in the past year, encouraging what they must later have decided is a poor 'history of account usage '. They also upgraded our cards to XXXX XXXX elite during the same period of 'history of account usage ' that was present during closure. 

In fact, I started using my primary card, the Arrival, exactly in a fashion that was advertised. I started using this card originally for everyday spend as well as to buy XXXX XXXX Gift Cards through the Barclay RewardsBoost mall, which they advertised on their own website was a great way to earn extra rewards. 

It seems clear to me that Barclay is closing our accounts because it is not profitable to provide us with rewards under the current program that they advertise, even though on their website, even today, it still shows "" Earn XXXX miles for every {$1.00} you spend on all your purchases '' and Redeem for travel statement credits starting at XXXX miles for {$25.00} toward a qualifying travel purchase of {$25.00} or more made within the last 120 days ''. 

With my last statement ( XXXX ) I had redeemed XXXX points ( {$140.00} ) but still had XXXX points adjusted at the closing of my account. 

If returning my account to good standing is not practicable, a payment for the miles which would have been worth the sum unredeemed as well as the annual fee for the services I could not receive but had already paid for seems reasonable : XXXX XXXX XXXX = {$380.00}.

My wife 's card had XXXX miles, which would have been worth {$19.00} XXXX XXXX = {$21.00}. 

I also paid a {$95.00} annual fee on this card, and on my wife 's card, totaling {$190.00} in fees which I am now not able to fully utilize given the cards were canceled in the middle of the membership year.

11/13/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I contracted with a home builder to build a new home. The mortgage company ( Citizens Bank ) requested that I let them know when the house is 75 % complete so that they can order the appraisal. On XX/XX/XXXX, I notified them that the house was XXXX % complete. I do n't know exactly when the appraisal was ordered, but I learned the day before our scheduled closing ( which was to be XXXX/XXXX/15 ) that there were problems with the appraisal, and the appraiser needed to complete some steps before closing. 
I managed to track down the appraiser 's email address and phone number, and contacted him to complete his appraisal. According to the appraiser, he did his appraisal, submitted it, fixed it upon request from Citizens Bank, and re-submitted. 
Citizens Bank did not have their job complete for our scheduled closing on XX/XX/XXXX, so the closing was delayed. I then had to reschedule appointments and deliveries that were to be handled on XX/XX/XXXX. I delayed them to be the next day. I also learned that the builder has a {$500.00} per-day fee that they will enforce for closing delays. They waived the fee for the first day delay. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX is XXXX, and a bank holiday, no progress was made that day. But we were assured it would be handled Thursday, and we could close Thursday afternoon. 
Mid-day Thursday, it became apparent that the closing would n't happen Thursday either. I again rescheduled appointments and deliveries from Thursday to Friday. By the close of business on Thursday, I was told that the appraiser still needed to submit some information to the bank. So essentially - no progress was made Thursday, either. 
We rescheduled the closing for Friday at XXXX. Early Friday morning, I drove to the house to take pictures that the appraiser needed to submit, and sent them to him to help move the process along. It is now noon on Friday, and the appraiser just told my real estate agent that he just now heard that he needs to submit pictures. It 's clear that we will not be closing today. I have family coming from out of town tomorrow to help us move, and it seems we will not be able to do that. There are now more deliveries that I need to reschedule again, certainly with financial penalties at this point. 
From my point of view, there has not been any progress on the appraisal since last week. The appraisal was ordered so late that it needed to go perfectly to avoid delaying the closing. But it did n't go perfectly. There were problems, still unresolved, and nobody can say when the closing will happen.

The dept responded back to me with some 'canned ' pre-written decline that all XXXX bureaus worked differently. I have spent almost 3 hours trying to resolve this. I have excellent credit and all I am asking for is fairness. Why would my score drop XXXX points on the Experian report yet rise XXXX pts on my other XXXX reports.

Additionally, I came back from XXXX XXXX last year after living and serving there as a XXXX for 7 years.

01/24/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I bank with TD Bank and have my mortgage, checking and savings accounts with TD Bank. When I moved from one address to another, I updated my address by calling TD Bank 's customer service, however, the agent failed to update my address for mortgage account while he updated it for my savings and checking account. TD Bank received undelivered mail for my mortgage account and never bothered to inform me through email or phone both of which they have available. In the meanwhile, the monthly mortgage payment went up from {$1000.00} to {$1000.00} due to change in escrow, hence increasing the payment by {$22.00}. I had an automatic payment set up from my TD Bank checking account to TD Bank mortgage for {$1000.00} monthly and was never made aware of the change in payment. I happened to see the change XX/XX/XXXX, almost 8 months after the change and called up TD Bank. They had by that time charged me several fines of {$33.00} each, used my payments for payment of additional principal pay downs and in ways that even customer service agent also could not fully explain what the algorithm used for my payments. In any case, I brought myself up to date by paying the fines and made the additional payments in XX/XX/XXXX and requested that I be paid back the fines and my credit report be corrected. I have maintained a large balance in checking account at TD Bank and there was always sufficient cash available in the account to pay the additional {$22.00} per month. Since I have been a customer of TD Bank for over 8 years, I thought it would be a simple thing to get my credit corrected and fines credited back to me after the bank looks at the circumstances. However, TD Bank refused to do so. I strongly believe that the issue arose because of their customer service agent 's mistake and second because they failed to inform me when they were getting my mail returned to them. I would appreciate if you will take up the matter with TD Bank and have the matter sorted out. I would like to have fines returned and most importantly my credit corrected.

This was due to the fatal technical problems from a Chase ATM machine malfunctioned on XXXX/XXXX/2016 during my deposit, please see the letters attached from Chase Bank and the cases that I reported at CFPB previously in the months of XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). Thus, I was not able to receive the XXXX rent from my tenant. The check sender, my tenant, informed me on XXXX/XXXX/2016 that her XXXX Bank account was hacked on XXXX/XXXX/2016 after Chase Bank deposited the {$2100.00} check on XXXX/XXXX/2016. As of XXXX/XXXX/2016, per my tenant, the funds in a total amount of {$2100.00} still has NOT recovered at my tenant 's XXXX Bank, and thus I have not received my XXXX rent in a total amount of {$2100.00} from my tenant. With a successful deposit at Chase on XXXX/XXXX/2016, I would NOT experience such painful problems for months. This could be proved easily from my Chase Plus Savings account ending in XXXX over the past three years as a tracking record/history that can be verified. This is the first time and hopefully the last time that I experience this painful ATM Technical issues. It raise red flags for me to ever use Chase ATM to deposit once again. All of the deposits ( both teller and ATM deposits ) went successfully except the XXXX check {$2100.00} deposited on XXXX/XXXX/2016 with a malfunctioned Chase ATM that cause horrible experience for me. 

Overall, I am dissatisfied with Chase Bank on handling this matter that indeed caused tremendous ripple-effect problems due to the root cause of Chase ATM malfunctioned occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Chase Bank has not resolved the issue completely as I still have not received the fund on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Chase Bank closed the case and refused to continue to help. The Chase Branch where the ATM located was not helpful at all from the employees and Branch Manager since XXXX/XXXX/2016. I urge Chase Bank to reopen this case and be responsible for this incident until it is resolved 100 %. Otherwise, I consider Chase Bank is irresponsible and CFPB should make every efforts to work with Chase Bank to resolve this issue at a satisfactory level in a timely manner. As it currently stands, it is at unsatisfactory level from JP Morgan Chase. I am totally disappointed and the CEO of Chase should be informed immediately about my dissatisfaction on how the matter was handled by JP Morgan Chase Bank - it is incomplete and the case was closed and Chase refused to continue helping me as their customer to recover {$2100.00} fund due to the original issue was caused by the CHASE ATM.

04/26/2016,Credit card,,Bankruptcy,,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I applied for an American Express Everyday card. I received an email stating that my application was pending. I got notification later that day that my application was declined due to past account closures with American Express. I called into American Express on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to discuss the declined application, the informed me that my application was declined due to prior accounts being charged off in Bankruptcy, and that until I paid them back to American Express, American Express would not issue me another credit card ( much different then what the letter I received stated ), I reminded the associate that the balances were discharged in bankruptcy and that I was legally not aloud to pay them back with out paying all my former creditors back. She still tried to transfer me to the recovery area so that I would pay the past balances back. This is a clear violation of US Federal Bankruptcy Code, Attempting to collect a debt after it has been discharged in bankruptcy. I informed the representatives manager of the situation, he tried to cover the situation up by saying she would never ask that I pay back a debt discharged in Bankruptcy. I asked him to have my application reviewed based on my credit worthiness and to speak to someone who could review my application manually instead of a screening software. He sent the request in and told me it would be 2-3 days. 

In the mean time, I tried getting in contact with American Express 's Executive Office to file a complaint against the representative who violated the law and to ensure that my application was being forwarded to the right area for manual review. I was unsuccessful in this matter. I found an email address online for the Chairman/CEO of which I sent an email outlining my complaint of illegal activity and my request. I received a phone call on XXXX/XXXX/2016 from XXXX of there Executive Referral team who listened to the call and did verify to me that the representative did in fact request that I pay off the balance in direct violation of US Bankruptcy law, and did confirm that she would be getting my application over to the appropriate area for manual review. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016 XXXX called me back and indicated that the RISK area of American Express reviewed my application and declined to move forward with it due to a prior loss American Express took. This is a second clear violation of federal law ( fair lending act ) as they are not basing the lending decision on credit worthiness, they are basing the decision solely on a prior loss American Express took in a bankruptcy. XXXX mentioned that the VP of risk reviewed the application for an override to the prior account closures ( very small loss in bankruptcy ). When I asked what criteria they looked at being that I have much higher income and assets then there standard Amex Everyday card customer ( being that this is there entry level card ) since they did not pull a hard copy or soft copy of my credit report all she could tell me was that it had to do with the prior accounts included in bankruptcy.

10/25/2016,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,Settlement process and costs,,"Let this letter serve as my formal complaint regarding a loan through US Bank. US Bank is engaging in unfair and abusive practices that have caused and will continue to cause me actual monetary harm. 

The acts arise out of a 2nd mortgage my wife and I took out on XX/XX/2016. The transaction was completed at the XXXX Minnesota bank branch. The purpose of the loan was to refinance high interest credit card debt, into a low interest 2nd mortgage. The total amount of the loan was for {$25000.00} At the time of closing US Bank told me they would send the payment in to my credit card providers. I did not ask for an address for my credit card providers, nor did I offer one. They did not provide me with any payment options. They elected to send cashiers checks on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX of the XXXX checks made it to my credit card providers without issue. The XXXX one valued at {$8800.00} did not. 

On XX/XX/2016, when it was clear that the payment had not cleared, I contacted the credit card provider and US Bank. The credit card provider did not have any documentation of receiving the cashiers check. US Bank has provided me with a letter they claim went out with the cashiers check, but no other proof that such payment ever made it to my credit card provider. I asked them to confirm whether the check had been cashed, they said they would look into it. 

On XX/XX/2016, I contacted US Bank, and again asked whether the cashiers check had been cashed, they got back to me later in the day and said that it had not been cashed. I asked them to stop payment on the cashiers check and reissue the check directly to me, to avoid additional delay in payment of my credit card bill. 

On XX/XX/2016, I followed up on the stop payment process. I was informed that I would have to sign a Declaration of Loss and Indemnity agreement in order for the process to be complete. I spoke to both XXXX XXXX and the branch manager, XXXX XXXX. XXXX assured me that the indemnification was n't a big deal, and that US Bank would not cash the funds if I signed the indemnification agreement. The declaration of loss required that I acknowledged that I loss the check. I did not sign this because it was factually untrue. I never had possession of the check, so I could not therefore lose the check. Im not even in a position to confirm or deny that US Bank actually sent the check to my credit card provider. Indeed, my credit card provider does not have any record of the check. The indemnification agreement would require that I indemnify US Bank if they happen to pay the funds of the cashiers check to anyone for any reason. I of course refused to sign that as well. 

Because I wont agree to sign a declaration of loss for a check I have never had possession of, and I wont sign the indemnification agreement, US Bank refuses to pay the remaining {$8800.00} owed to me under the mortgage agreement. It is my understanding that they may or may not pay the funds after a 90 day waiting period. They refuse to waive the interest for the {$8800.00} that they have not paid me.

I had a credit card with Susquehanna Bank serviced by XXXX XXXX. BB & T purchased Susquehanna Bank and all customers were "" transitioned ''. We retained a credit card if we had XXXX. On XXXX XXXX 2016 I applied for a BB & T XXXX XXXX card with the sole purpose to use it as a low balance business card to make XXXX or less material purchases for my small business and take advantage of the 0 % introductory interest rate. I applied for the card IN PERSON at my local branch. I was immediately approved but for a very low credit limit. with a credit score of XXXX and a credit limit of XXXX on my current visa I asked why? My local banker called BB & T and they said they raised the credit limit to XXXX confirming it with my branch the next day. AT NO TIME was a balance transfer discussed. A few days later I received a letter from BB & T stating I had been approved for a XXXX with a credit limit of XXXX. 3 days later my card came, I activated it but did not make any purchases at that time. Upon checking my online balance a few days later on BB & T 's online banking website I noticed there was a XXXX balance on my new card. I immediately went to my local branch and questioned this. My banker noted that I was NOT the only person this happened to, and perhaps it was a glitch of some kind. When he called BB & T they said they were getting a high volume of calls about cards that day. My banker was connected to a supervisor of some kind and they stated I initiated a balance transfer. My banker then physically pulled the paper application I filled out for the card and signed and dated IN MY OWN HAND. The "" balance transfer certificate '' section was BLANK. Upon further arguing back and forth BB & T faxed over a "" new '' application that had the balance transfer certificate filled out in TYPE FACE and DID NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE on it. My banker argued that I had not asked for the transfer, BB & T said they would waive the XXXX dollar finance charges on the transfer but that I was now responsible for the debt. No one can explain how or why the balance transfer happened or who authorized it. BB & T then claimed that once a customer signs a document that signature can be used on any other document they choose. With Susquehanna my monthly payment was under XXXX, this was within my very tight budget. The balance transfer nearly maxed out the new card, and brought my monthly payment up to nearly XXXX a month FAR outside my ever tightening budget, and it made the prospect of using the card impossible and further caused me financial hardship. They are unbending and uncooperative in helping me with this issue and left the blame for this incident on the branch and the banker who submitted the application. I was there and I NEVER asked for a balance transfer nor did the banker in question. BB & T corporate is at fault and should be blamed, investigated and reprimanded for their actions NOT my local banker or the local Branch.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BB&T Financial,NJ,083XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/21/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2170388

Having been hit with unexpected expenses, I contacted them and received a loan in the amount of XXXX and was told that finance charges would total XXXX, though high, I accepted. 

The loan documents that I was able to view at that time did NOT show the "" Truth in Lending Disclosure '' that is part of them now. that I would be making interest only payments totaling {$1500.00} plus the amount of the loan for a total payment amount of {$1800.00} for a {$350.00} loan. 

The practice is beyond deceptive and a quick check of this company online shows many victims in the same boat as I am. I am continuing to make payments as per the agreement ( which again I was told would have a finance charge of {$120.00} not {$15000.00} ) for fear of having my credit impacted. This is a deceptive loan practice and have learned by a quick search that I am far from the only person to have been scammed by these people. 

A quick search of the internet showed that even though they are a "" Tribal '' lending ( and I use that term to be polite ) company, that the FTC has been granted authority to go after companies that engage in these practices. 

In any court, finding that a company is charging at finance charge of {$1500.00} for a {$350.00} loan totaling charges of {$1800.00} is, to the best of my knowledge, illegal.

The payment of {$130.00} is deducted automatically from my account on the XXXX of each month. In XXXX of this year, I was waiting for an invoice to be mailed to me for work I had done, but I knew it would n't arrive in time for the payment to Citibank. So I called Citibank 's Customer Service number and spoke to a representative, she said she would be glad to delay the payment for a week ( I only asked for a two-day extension. ) ( Enclosure 1 ). She obviously botched the arrangement ; not only was the payment deducted on the XXXX, which over-drafted my account, it was deducted AGAIN a week later. My credit union charged me a {$35.00} fee for the overdraft. I called Citibank again and spoke with "" XXXX '', employee # XXXX, and explained what happened. He agreed to refund the extra {$130.00} deduction, but said I would have to send proof of the overdraft fee to the Citibank Consumer Credit Investigation division to get the {$35.00} overdraft fee repaid. I promptly sent Citibank the information ( Enclosure 2, 3, and 4 ). About two weeks later I received a letter from Citibank ( Enclosure 5 ) saying they would refund the extra {$130.00} payment, which they did. However, they also said I would have to send proof of the overdraft fee. I told them I had already sent the information, and would not do so again-they would have to walk to the Credit Investigations Office to retrieve my letter, which was in the same building. ( Enclosure 6. ) Citibank did not refund my overdraft fee, or even respond to my letter ; in fact, I have heard nothing at all from them since. I asked my credit union how to stop Citibank from withdrawing funds from my account, and they said to write them a formal letter revoking their authorization. So, about a month later XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I sent a letter via certified mail to Citibank ( specifically XXXX XXXX ) formally revoking Citibanks ' authorization to withdraw any more payments from my account until they refunded my {$35.00} overdraft fee. They have also ignored this letter ( which I have proof of delivery from the USPS, Enclosure 7 ), and on XXXX XXXX, they again withdrew the payment from my account, which again over-drafted my account and incurred another {$35.00} fee ( See enclosure 8. ) As a result of Citibanks ' willful disregard for my revocation of their authority to withdraw funds from my account, I have had to close my account with the credit union. 
I am therefore demanding that Citibank ( 1 ) refund my {$70.00} in overdraft fees IMMEDIATELY, and ( 2 ) NOT try to add the amount back into the loan at a later date. I have already told Citibank that they will not receive any more payments from me until my overdraft fees are refunded, nor will I be liable for any late charges incurred as a result of them dragging their feet. As far as I am concerned, this situation is a direct result of their arrogant, unethical, and to my mind, illegal behavior. 
I also think it would be appropriate to fine them for disregarding my formal demand to stop the automatic withdrawl of funds. It infuriates me that companies like this think they are above the law, accountable to no one, and can do whatever they want without fear of reprisal.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,AZ,852XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/04/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,Yes,2046129

We found XXXX and when it came to closing the underwriter from Supreme Lending stated that all we needed to close was XXXX bank statements, and to pay off a couple of assets. This was presented again, but to us ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ), my realtor, the sellers ( husband and wife ), and sellers realtor on a conference call with XXXX XXXX ( Loan Officer ) that we were already approved ALL we needed was XXXX bank statement from new bank acct, and to pay off a couple of assets.

I then started to talk to XXXX another employee at Supreme Lending because I became worried. She also said that we were close to closing, she does not see any reason why we would n't be able to, she also spoke with the sellers as well. I have many of text messages and conversations that this was uncalled for, and the outcome was ridiculous. 
We, the sellers and I had been told numerous times that we will be closing next week, but next week never came. This has not only left my family and I homeless, but also have put the sellers into a lot of grief, they also will not be able to close on the home they had built for them.

Please see where it says Note 2. They have threatened to seize my bank account and I know for a fact that is illegal in Texas. I consider this a direct violation of the Texas Fair Debt Collections Act. Please see the excerpt from that Act : Harassment and Fraud are Prohibited State law prohibits the use of harassment and abusive collection tactics. It is illegal for any debt collector to : threaten XXXX or other criminal acts ; use profane or obscene language ; falsely accuse the consumer of fraud or other crimes ; threaten arrest of the consumer, or repossession or other seizure of property without proper court proceedings ; use the telephone to harass debtors by calling anonymously or making repeated or continuous calls ; make collect telephone calls without disclosing the true name of the caller before the charges are accepted. 
The use of fraudulent or deceptive practices is also prohibited, including : using a false name or identification ; misrepresenting the amount of the debt or its judicial status ; sending documents to a debtor that falsely appear to be from a court or other official agency ; failing to identify who holds the debt ; misrepresenting the nature of the services rendered by the collection agency or the collector ; falsely representing that the collector has information or something of value in order to discover information about the consumer. 
Your home and wages : Some collectors will threaten to take your home or wages to pay for a debt. In Texas, if your residence has been declared a homestead, it can not be taken to pay a debt except for debts taken for the purchase of the home ( ie, a mortgage in default ), for home improvements, for home equity loans or to pay certain taxes. Wages may be garnished only to pay debts related to court-ordered child support, back taxes, and defaulted student loans. Debt collectors can not garnish wages for repayment of consumer debt. 

You can read about declaring your home as your homestead, for which you will receive certain tax exemptions as well as protection against debt collectors here : XXXX ( tax exemption FAQs ).",,ACE Cash Express Inc.,TX,775XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/26/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2078638

On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I started receiving letters demanding immediate payment of amounts I could n't afford ( on this date, for {$890.00} ) ; this letter even mentioned at the bottom contacting them about programs they offer to help me clear this debt. I copied the letter and, with the scheduled XXXX coupon, mailed it to them, with copies of all the other payment coupons through XXXX 2016 to show that I 'd already made arrangements to pay on this debt. I never heard anything but on XXXX XXXX, 2016 got another "" demand '' letter stating I needed to pay {$1000.00} immediately, but knowing I 'd already mailed them proof that the payment agreed upon was scheduled, I ignored this letter. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received another letter stating they had sent me several messages about the account 's past due status and that is was more than 90 days delinquent! This one asked for a payment of {$1100.00} IMMEDIATELY and state that, because of this, the account was closed ( I 'd hoped by having these arranged payments I could save myself from preventing this happening and keep the account open due to the low interest rate of 8.9 % ). This letter was sent AFTER the agreed upon payment set in XXXX 2016 had already been paid as scheduled! At this point I again called USAA on XXXX/XXXX/16 ( I had been out of town for several weeks ) and spoke to XXXX XXXX, supposedly of the Executive department of USAA 's Debt Solutions, and explained all this to her. She said she 'd look into this, but that the payments I agreed to were too low and that 's why the letters were sent. How can I be held accountable for a mistake someone in THEIR department made in the beginning when I talked to this department back on XXXX XXXX, 2016? Also, there was no way I could have paid more, being unemployed, then underemployed at the time. 
I have not heard from anyone since, but just had my credit union account debited TWICE from USAA on XXXX/XXXX/2016, one for a payment of the originally agreed to amount of {$120.00}, for which a reminder letter was sent out on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Then on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I got another letter showing the initial contact date of XXXX XXXX with a payment due on XXXX XXXX of {$120.00}, so I thought this meant they had raised the amount due to {$120.00} ( and this was the only "" contact '' I received, this letter with the new amount - no one ever called to tell me this, nor were any documents online in USAA to tell me about this, or any other decisions that had been made ). More confusing is that I also received another letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 that showed a contact date of XXXX XXXX, 2016 with a payment due date of XXXX XXXX, 2016 for {$120.00} - very confusing! But they debited BOTH amounts on XXXX XXXX WITHOUT AUTHORITY to debit BOTH! So, I am now incurring insufficient fee charges and ca n't pay other bill since they took out {$240.00}, unbeknownst to me, and which I could n't afford! 
Dealing with them has been a nightmare, and after this event, it is time to make a formal complaint and involve an outside agency.

I therefore advised XXXX that I was going to go with Citi. XXXX then cancelled the application. There was no communication from Citi all week when I tried to set a closing date. They did n't respond to calls and emails all week. They then emailed at XXXX on Friday stating that their appraisal was much lower than confirmed on the phone and if I wanted financing for the house at the previous level there would be all kinds on new costs and restrictions including having to keep assets of $ 100k in a Citi account prior to and after closing. 

Again, scurrilous sales practices paired with no communication after makes for very unethical behavior.

I filed a complaint on here and their representative called me, told me there is nothing they will do without further proof of my case and are still actively reporting a fraudulent account as one that is valid underneath my social security number. I have now placed extended fraud alerts on every credit bureau and will be pursuing legal action against this company. For any potential consumers out there here is what happened to me : Barclaycard began reporting a fraudulent account underneath my name and after I called in no less than 10 times to report this the account was kept open and reported on my credit reports with my social security number. After filing a complaint on here, a company representative called me and told me that they would conduct an investigation. They took 1 DAY to go through months of calls and openly accused me of committing fraud using this fraudulent card I never opened or wanted with their company. For any potential consumers stay as far away from this company as possible. There were multiple cases of fraud committed by someone using my social security number and each and every other company I have dealt with was helpful and wonderful with assisting me.

07/07/2015,Credit card,,Delinquent account,,"I have some issues regarding my Amazon Store Card account, I was hoping that someone would help clear-up : In XX/XX/XXXX after using the same password when logging into my online account since I first opened my account, my password no longer worked. I called customer service about this so I could make a payment, they said they had my bank account info and would process a payment. I also asked for a replacement card at that time. Unbeknownst to me, my XX/XX/XXXX payment which I made online had not been credited! Then later in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter that said my account was delinquent, to my great surprise. Now both of my last XXXX payments made failed on their end and my account was n't credited! So I sent a personal check payment along but did n't have time to call because I was going to be out of town for awhile. 

On XXXX XXXX, I had time and called customer service again, my first XXXX attempts I was hung-up on after holding for very long times. After a hour of trying to speak to a rep, I was finally successful and got to speak with XXXX about the events that occurred. We spoke about how my payments were n't being credited, which she could n't give me a reason for. We also discussed how my passwords were n't working and how I was unable to access my online account, again she did n't know why. She helped me access my online account and told me I had n't been charged any online late fees and that I was in good standing. XXXX also said she would send me the replacement card I had n't received from my last request. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called customer service again because my new password was n't working again and I was unable to access my account. I again had to request a replacement card because I still had n't receive one since the last XXXX requests. Once online I now could n't view all of my previous statements, even though I was always able to in the past. 

Of greatest concern is that in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a copy of my credit report and saw that Synchrony Bank reported me as delinquent past XXXX days in XX/XX/XXXX. This is unfair considering my attempts to make payments and access my online account failed due to problems at Synchrony Bank. I ask that Synchrony Bank fix this and remove this blemish off of my credit report immediately. 

Overall the experience recently with SB bank has been very disappointing, frustrating, and time consuming. I never had problems with this account before Synchrony Bank took over my account from GE. I look forward to hearing from someone from Synchrony Bank regarding the negative mark left on my credit report.

12/02/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I just emerged from a Chapter XXXX. At the start of the proceedings CitiMortgage filed a claim for {$8000.00} in arrearages. The Trustee was to pay the {$8000.00} over the course of the Chapter XXXX. I was to continue to pay my regular monthly payment going forward. The Chapter XXXX ended in XXXX of this year. CitiMortgage claims that I am over {$5000.00} in arrears now. They told me in a letter that they will start foreclosure proceedings on XXXX XXXX of this year. They claim that I have missed XXXX payments in a row. I have sent them bank statements proving that we have made every mortgage payment since the start of the bankruptcy. 

More than XXXX Citi representative has admitted that they have used my regular monthly payment to cover arrearages. For instance. I was told that my first payment under the Chapter XXXX on XXXX went to pay the XXXX arrearage. Payments from both the Trustee and myself have been going to pay the arrearages before anything else. By no means have they separated the payments from the Trustee and myself. 

This is my understanding. "" Payments from the trustee or debtor post-confirmation should be applied to payments due from the Petition Date going forward - not to the arrearages. All post-petition installment payments must be applied and credited to the debtor 's mortgage account as if the account were current and no prepetition default exists ( this includes any adequate protection payments received pre-confirmation ). "" I have been told by a Bankruptcy specialist at Citi that this is how they do their accounting and there is nothing she can do about it. We entered into the Chapter XXXX in good faith. We made every regular monthly payment. The Trustee made all of her payments. Yet we are coming out of this being made to feel like a common mortgage dodger with a foreclosure looming over our head.

We got a pack in the mail issuing us to go to court so we called them and they said if you send in a paper stating a payment plan that could be set up, have it notarized, send it back within a week than we would n't have to go to court. We wrote out a paper stating that we would pay {$150.00} a month till it was paid off that same day, had it notarized and faxed it over and called to confirm they received it. While paying them they were very rude about any questions that we had and regularly gave us the run around when trying to find out how much we had left to pay or even if they were getting the payments. Many times they hung up on us or would simply put us on hold till we hung up. We had one gentleman that works for them call us at XXXX at night to ask if we sent a payment in and when we asked who it was he hung up on my husband. The law office works very strangely and is not very nice. We eventually got in contact with who the debt was originally through and made a settlement offer through them. When they approved the deal, they contacted XXXX and told them we could pay off the loan in the amount of {$2000.00} on XXXX XXXX 2015. We made the check out and sent it in and asked for a paper just stating that the debt was paid off and we did n't have to worry about it anymore and they never returned our calls or sent us anything in the mail. A receptionist called my husband 2 weeks ago on XXXX XXXX 2015 and asked if the debt was paid off. He said yes and we are still waiting on a paper confirming it. The lady rudely said that it was cleared up on their end and hung up the phone.

06/25/2016,Credit card,,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,,"The following complaint involves the unscrupulous business practices of a XXXX XXXX XXXX travel agent, XXXX and my credit card company, Chase VISA 's biased judgment involving my appeal and subsequent denial for stopping payment of fraudulent charges. 
HISTORY : On XXXX XXXX 2016 I filed a complaint with Chase for what turned out to be XXXX ' sale of airline tickets procured with brokered third party frequent flyer points - a procedure against all airline rules. ( See attachment ) Upon discovery of this fraudulent procurement both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX cancelled my XXXX airline tickets, paid in full directly to the company and charged onto my VISA. While I was misled in the method of procurement and not aware of any risks involved, the company had full knowledge that the tickets could be cancelled. 
XXXX ' DECEPTION : XXXX XXXX confirmed that it was offering lower- priced tickets as a wholesale travel consolidator and that if, I did n't accept frequent flyer points for flights, they could negotiate favorable pricing with the airlines. Their Ticket Release Form states that tickets are "" issued using corporate points "". My understanding was that corporate points means literally points owned by the corporation to process a transaction. In fact, according to XXXX Fraud Department, XXXX was misleading me because they did not use corporate points but brokered third party points. I was sold airline tickets under false conditions. ( See Attachment ) * XXXX alleges that it was I who cancelled the above mentioned flights on XXXX and XXXX. Supporting evidence from the respective airlines clearly indicates that this was a fabricated lie. 
CHASE 'S REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE TERMS OF A FRAUDULENT CONTRACT : In appealing the {$10000.00} charges, Chase VISA Card Member Services refused to acknowledge XXXX ' wrong doing and denied my appeal on the grounds that I signed XXXX contract - their Ticket Release Form. Even though I had no knowledge that the tickets were procured in a method contrary to that which was stated in the Ticket Release Form, my signature invalidated any claims I made of illegal or improper behavior. 
CHASE 'S BIASED HANDLING OF MY CASE It 's my understanding that as my bank, I should be able to rely on Chase and its issuing credit card company - Chase Visa XXXX Card, to support me impartially in cases as this. 
Through the past six months I believe that Chase 's response to my appeal calls into question whether this dispute has been managed impartially : XXXX XXXX pages pf crucial pieces of evidence were completely ignored ; XXXX Chase 's investigative team made no effort to contact those supporting my appeal to obtain documentation or clarification ; XXXX In the appeal process, Chase allowed XXXX two months to defend their business practices while I was given 16 days ; * I was denied easy access to a representative and periodic updates. Each of my many phone calls was met with skepticism and followed by contradicting responses, conveying the impression that no one was in charge of my case I 'm seeking support from your Bureau and am ready to provide you with additional documentation detailing the above-written points.",,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,NY,117XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/25/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1985283

12/31/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"I 've had several on-going issues with TransUnion. I 've attempted to resolve them multiple times and unfortunately, they continue to violate the FCRA as well as the federal bankruptcy laws. I 've sent them documentation ( list of creditors included in my bankruptcy ) and they continue to report fabricated information to my file. I have outlined the issues below : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX-I had XXXX accounts with this credit union all which were included in bankruptcy. They are reporting XXXX accounts. In speaking to their representative, they have also included the XXXX accounts that were lost or stolen in XXXX, 2011. Long before I filed bankruptcy, these accounts were closed and new accounts were reissued. Therefore, they could NOT be included in any bankruptcy. The information listed under these XXXX accounts is fabricated. They are reporting as XXXX separate "" Unsecured Loans ''. The account numbers are also fabricated. They were open on the exact same date as the original credit cards with the same balances and limits. This is disturbing to me that TransUnion feels that they can make up accounts in my name and report them to my file as included in bankruptcy even after I 've sent them a list of my creditors where it shows that XXXX accounts were included, no more, no less. This has been going on for nearly XXXX years now and I have suffered for that long. 
2. XXXX XXXX XXXX- Recently, Transunion decided to report the line of credit that was also included in my bankruptcy as a open account. An account discharged in a chapter XXXX bankruptcy nearly two years ago CAN NOT BE OPEN. I contacted TU on XXXX XXXX when I noticed the change, and the representative found my BK paperwork and closed it down. On XXXX XXXX, they claimed that the creditor contacted them and reopened it. This creditor has not updated these accounts since last year. What would possess them to contact them randomly and report inaccurate information? It did n't happen. XXXX changed this account as they continuously do every few months. I contact them at least every 3 months to get these accounts corrected. This is getting old. 
3. I 've had multiple credit files with TU and I had to ask for a year for them to combine them. They would pick and choose which one to send to the creditor that requested my credit file. This violates the FCRA as the information being reported must be complete and accurate. When they finally merged the file, I noticed my score dropped significantly. It was because the inquiries that hit my file last year due to fraud were never actually removed as the creditors asked them to do, they were simply placed on the second file. I had XXXX inquiries added to my report when I only had XXXX that were not fraud initially. 
4. I reached out to several creditors within my bankruptcy and asked them to remove their trade-lines, they agreed. I was advised to dispute them with all credit reporting agencies and they would respond by deleting the account. I did just that and just as they promised, they deleted the accounts from XXXX and XXXX, but have never received a dispute for deletion regarding TU. TransUnion is not processing my disputes correctly-either they are verifying my name and date of birth, address and SSN and that 's it, or they are not sending the disputes at all. 
5. I 've repeatedly asked them to provide me with their dispute procedure for each account, who they talked to, how they verified the account and they have yet to respond. They 've recently added verbiage to my file stating I have recent lates and caused me to be declined for credit line increases and credit. This is also fabricated and needs to be deleted from my file. I 've called and they claim that it is my bankruptcy that is causing the verbiage-my BK is 2 years old and it was never on there before, so why now 2 years later? 
6. I submitted a dispute on XXXX and never received results

09/17/2016,Credit reporting,,Unable to get credit report/credit score,Problem getting report or credit score,"I was purchasing new vehicle and applied for Auto loan from XXXX financing at special 0.9 % APR rate. During credit check, they said I do n't have any credit score when they checked with Transunion services. I called Transunion to find out what went wrong. They said that I have no credit score and My creditors are not reporting to them. So, I tried little research about credit score, because I have account with XXXX credit card and receiving FICO score above XXXX on every month statement. I verified with my creditors ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX credit card, XXXX student loan ) and they said they are legally sending all reports every month to Transunion, XXXX and other credit agencies. I contacted transunion again to inform them that they are receiving my credit history like other people as per my creditors. I spoke with customer representative and supervisor, also try to ask them to initiate investigation for this discrepancy. They refused to believe me and opening any investigation for this matter. They told me to go back to creditors and ask them to contact Transunion. Meanwhile, I signed up on XXXX XXXX to see my actual credit score. I had XXXX Excellent credit score reported by XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Somehow, no score from Transunion. I called back to Transunion and let them know I have excellent score from XXXX and no score from you. XXXX of unbelieving. Why my creditors reporting to everyone except Transunion?? Banks have many clients and they reports to all credit agency. I applied several times for different dealers and banks to get loan for my new vehicle. No one accepted my credit score from XXXX and gave me interest rate of 3.99 % APR instead of 0.9 % APR if they have accepted my Excellent score of XXXX from XXXX. Due to several credit checks, my score is down to XXXX now. I got frustrated because I was paying my bills, rents and taxes on time or before time with no due balance. Still as good credit individual, I did n't eligible to buy new vehicle with 0.9 % or below 3.99 % APR rate. Meanwhile, I told my creditors to provide my credit history to Transunion to fix this issue. I got a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX that they have been providing my credit history to all credit agency including Transunion. I am hoping after all these, Transunion may have some credit history from my creditors, not surely believing yet. I lost of best deals of having lower interest rate of 0.9 %, but got accepted new rate of 2.49 % from XXXX XXXX XXXX within seconds due to good credit from other credit agencies. Overall, I am end up going through all these XXXX, paying more interest rate than I would have, all these just because Transunion messed up keeping records properly, not showing courtesy to find discrepancy into their system, rudely saying you have to contact and resolve issue by yourself. I mean after they new they had problems, they never investigate this kind of situation to compare with other credit agency records. We as consumer paying more money, getting XXXX due this credit agency. I would like to report this issue and strictly take action against this kind of Non-conformance and irresponsible behavior towards consumer. Please review the Transunion feedback on internet, you will find many people like me who do n't exist with Transunion score system.

A few years back I noticed that Midland Funding showed up on my credit report and disputed it through XXXX and XXXX because I did n't know who they were. I received a letter from the credit reporting agency that they did not respond so it was removed. Last year my work received a garnishment letter from the Sheriff. I was given this information from my employeer. I contacted Midland Funding who referred me to the collection agency they had turned it over to. When I contacted the collection agency the informed me that this was for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I financed a vehicle for my family member back in 2001 and never knew the vehicle was taken back by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was able to verify the date that the last payment was made. I contacted the courts to see when a judgement was filed. I contacted an attorney who informed me that the statue to file a judgement in NY was six years from the last payment. After verifying this the judgement was filed after six years and I was never served with paper from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Midland Funding or the collection agency that they were suing me for this debt. The collection agency informed me that payments were made to them in the last coule of years, I asked them for copies of these payments made which they said they could n't provide me. This clearly is because I never made payments to them and my family member who I financed the vehicle never made payments them either. I want proof of these payments made within the statue of limitations which were never provided. I was informed to file a complaint through this site and am also going to seek an attorney as well to assit with this matter. I would like assistance to find out how they can violate the law and not provide me with this so called payment that I made to this account. I would like this documentation but none of them will provide me with this because it is not the case. I was told that you could assist with getting them to provide this since their acting in violation of the states laws. I notice that the collection agency they placed this with has been sued several times due to this. I was told I could also file something with the attorney general which I will also be ding today.

I made the transfer at a First Merit ATM during regular business hours. The purchase was made and approved less than XXXX minutes later ( the bank is a block from the retailer ). On XXXX XXXX my online statement reflected these transactions but with the statement incorrectly reflecting that the purchase had occurred prior to the transfer of funds necessary to cover the purchase. Although my online balance reflected a negative balance associated with the purchase, no overdraft charge was reflected, my overall balance was in the black, and the actual transfer was additionally reflected in a separate statement section marked "" pending '' ... '' Hold ''. On XXXX XXXX my online balance reflected XXXX separate {$35.00} overdraft charges ( {$170.00} ) as a direct result of the bank 's failure to recognize that the transfer of funds preceded the purchase that, according to my statement, caused the overdraft. Per bank policy, I was required to personally visit my home branch to seek management correction of the bank 's error. I did just that on XXXX XXXX. There I was informed that, despite the fact that my records reflect that at no time was my checking account lacking sufficient funds to cover the purchase, by transacting my money transfer at the bank 's ATM ( as opposed to in-person or online ), I had inadvertently - based upon their policy and practice - in fact made the transfer ( for their accounting purposes ) on XXXX XXXX ... not XXXX XXXX as their time-stamped receipt reflects. I was further informed that, despite the transfer occurring during normal business hours, they had already "" balanced out '' that particular ATM for the XXXX XXXX business day. In fact, my time-stamped XXXX XXXX XXXX receipt of the transfer does ( further down ) identify the business day as XXXX XXXX ( a fiction both in reality and practice as the bank 's branch hours on XXXX XXXX continued until XXXX ). Finally I was informed by the branch manager that a call would be made on my behalf seeking a resolution. An hour later, the branch manager left me a voicemail cheerfully informing me that the bank had decided to "" waive '' XXXX of the XXXX overdraft charges levied against my checking account. I attempt to return the call but was only able to leave a message stating that their "" resolution '' offer of ONLY stealing {$70.00} from me instead of {$170.00} was unacceptable.

Other than taking the necessary steps to find and establish another banking institution for my banking needs, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate First Merit 's unethical and arbitrary abuse of depositors ' funds specifically regarding the transfer and/or "" business day '' posting of funds between one FM account to another FM account. In my particular case, I am requesting that First Merit be required to refund all XXXX overdraft charges ( not just XXXX ) levied on my checking account. More importantly, I am hopeful that First Merit be required to 'cease and desist ' from continuing their apparent practice of 'posting ' credits and deposits/transfers in such a manner as to artificially create non-existent overdrafts.

Someone had used my debit card information to spend {$150.00} at XXXX department store. I had my card in my possession, so the thief had actually stolen the information, but not the card itself. I immediately filed an official fraud claim with Wells Fargo, and they were able to discontinue that card and give me the money back, along with a new debit card which I started using the very next day. However, the next time I checked my bank statement I noticed another fraudulent charge on my bank statement for {$410.00} from XXXX XXXX and XXXX, using the same card number, that showed as happening on XXXX XXXX. I again immediately filed a fraud claim with Wells Fargo, and they provisionally put the money back in my account while they investigated. 

Yesterday, I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying they decided that the {$410.00} charge was NOT fraudulent, and they would be closing my claim. They sent a copy of the XXXX XXXX and XXXX receipt, which showed that the thief had bought XXXX {$200.00} gift cards, and scribbled an obviously fake signature. The date of the transaction was XXXX XXXX, a day before I received the Wells Fargo Fraud Notification Text about the XXXX XXXX transaction, but I never received a notification for this transaction and moreover, it did n't appear in my bank statement until XXXX XXXX so I was not able to notify Wells Fargo in a timely manner due to their own system delaying me by over a week.

I asked the rep to stop speaking to me in that manner and he continued to talk over me and yell. I explained that I had never been contacted on my personal phone and even provided number and rep continues to call my employer asking to speak to anyone who works with me. They also threated to call my HR director to tell her I do not pay my bills and start garnishment process. They even said everyone in my agency will know I do n't pay my bills. I got very upset and told person on the phone that I can not continue to speak to someone so disrespectful and hung up. The company kept calling me back and yelling at me. I have never in my life been spoken to this way. I am concerned as they stated they are calling back to speak to the head of my company. Company wanted me to set up payments of an amount I could not agree to and I was told "" What is wrong with you? You ca n't afford {$70.00} bucks a month and you work. What kind of job do you have.

I could not believe what I was reading and in turn called XXXX where I was greeted with the rudest people that I have ever talked to. I explained that I never received a bill from Sears or Citi bank the representative then said it was emailed to me. I then explained do not get any of my bills via email they continued to say that was impossible and I received the bill and that was all there was to the issue. I again asked why did n't I get a paper bill they said it did not make any difference they wanted their {$57.00} plus late fees of {$65.00}. 
The purchases were made in XXXX XXXX but I had not used the account since XXXX XXXX. I just was appalled of the verbal abuse that I received from the customer service department. I then asked how did the letter get to me and not the bill? I still do not understand how they had my email address the only logical thing that I know of is that XXXX just transferred all their accounts from XXXX XXXX to Citi bank the same as Sears transferring their accounts to Citi bank and that the information was shared between units. 
After my very unsatisfactory conversation from Citi Bank customer Service I called Sears Customer Service who was very apologetic for my experience. They also removed the late fee payments and continued to state that there have been a large number of accounts that did not get their bills. She also said this is particularly true for accounts that have not been used for a long time.

However, the local police were able to narrow the thief down to a local person due to other information they gathered ( so it was not a thief from XXXX or other non-USA location ), but they seem to have stopped working on the case due to other priorities. If there is any way you can get Experian to release the CC number and email address used in opening this {$1.00} trial account on XX/XX/XXXX so I can give it to the local police for additional follow up, that would be great. Or if you have any other suggestions on how to get this information to help in the police investigation, please advise. I was very disappointed that Experian would not help investigate this unauthorized access to my credit history, and also amazed at how easy it was for someone to gain access to my credit history via their website.

We further state that if they check their records they will see that all of our payments have been credited before the grace period has elapsed. We ask politely to not call back unless we fail to have our payment to them by the fifteenth of the month. Usually they are rude and say that the reason for the call is that it is the first of the month and the payment is due. We get nowhere with them and ask thatthey refrain from calling again. However, this cycle is repeated over and over again sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. Each time a different representative who claims there is no record of any previous call in their system. Yea right! This practice of harassment has been going on each month for the last year. My wife has to field these calls all day long and is frustrated that we can not find a method to have them cease. I have threatened lidigation, contacted the do not call list and have had to become forceful in my response to them on the phone all in hopes we can stop this harassment. Nothing has worked.

04/29/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Money was not available when promised,,"Below is the email complaint I submitted to MoneyGram 's Online Complaint Page ... 
Today was my XXXX and XXXX time using MoneyGram. I received the absolute worse, most harrowing service that I have ever experienced in my life. At XXXX XXXX I completed a cash transaction with MoneyGram for {$6000.00} + {$120.00} in transfer fees, and {$7.00} in transfer taxes. I was wiring money to my son 's father in South Carolina. Last XXXX, I was in a car wreck that totaled my vehicle. My son 's father was helping me with the purchase of another vehicle, so getting the money to him was urgent. Let me pause to say, I resent even having to explain why I was using your service as it is a violation of my privacy and I am paying you handsomely to provide the service. In any case, I paid for your service which promised that my receiver would be able to pick the funds up within 10 minutes. That did not happen. Instead he was told that there was a hold on the transaction and the folk at his South Carolina XXXX location told him to tell me I would have to ride back up to XXXX to resolve the issue. I returned to XXXX ( a huge inconvenience ) with all my paperwork showing that I 'd paid for the service and sent the money and it was confirmed that there was a hold. I was told I needed to speak with a MoneyGram agent who needed to ask me some questions. Needless to say, I 'm heated at this point. I 've paid for a service I did n't receive. Now, I need to be questioned about why I am sending the money, my relationship to the person to whom I am sending it, and what the money will be used for. At XXXX I refused to be forthcoming with that information as it was no one 's business. Frankly, if MoneyGram was truly concerned about these issues they would have asked these questions on the front end, before they took my cold-hard cash, processed the transaction, gave me a receipt indicating that the service I purchased would be provided. Instead, MoneyGram took the cash then proceeded to treat me like a suspect in some sort of scam operation all the while holding my funds hostage. Furthermore, every MoneyGram associate I spoke with was patronizing and condescending. XXXX so called supervisor even hung up on me! When the XXXX associate called back to advocate on my behalf the original MoneyGram agent who gave us the name XXXX ( Operator # XXXX ), hung up on her. Finally, a XXXX Manager got involved and a MoneyGram agent hung up on her too. I am absolutely appalled! The hold on my transaction was not released until an hour and a half after I had paid for the XXXX minute service. In between, I was treated horribly and inconveniently by every MoneyGram agent with whom I spoke and I PAID for YOUR SERVICE, {$120.00}. When I flat out asked the agent -- she gave the name XXXX -- if there was anything MoneyGram was willing to do to make-up for the way in which I had been treated and inconvenienced, she said, "" Absolutely not, '' and ... "" Yes, that 's what I 'm telling you ... '' [ In response to my question, so you all are n't going to do anything? ] I ca n't believe a company as well-known as yours treats their customers this awful. Frankly, given the humiliation I was forced to endure and the long delay ( one and a half-hour ) instead of the XXXX minutes I paid for, I feel strongly that I should be reimbursed the {$120.00}, as I did not receive the service I paid for. When I asked the agent XXXX if they do this to all of their customers he responded, "" No, just when it 's suspicious. '' I 'm a XXXX woman. I was sending the money to my son 's father a XXXX XXXX with the clearly XXXX name XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I ca n't help but wonder if my own telling "" XXXX XXXX accented '' XXXX and XXXX 's name were "" suspicious. '' I 'm inclined to believe this may be true as I watched a XXXX gentleman next to me using MoneyGram endure the same treatment.

This complaint involves many parties ( The Merchant, The issuing Bank and VISA XXXX XXXX, all of which I have filed individual complaints. The party in this complaint is Capital One Bank in what I feel is in violation Claims and Defenses Provision and the Fair Credit Billing act. I have also asked VISA XXXX to investigate Capital One BankThe merchandise purchased was a sofa, delivered during the holidays in late XX/XX/XXXX using VISA XXXX. It was decided that the quality of the sofa was questionable. It definitely is n't 100 % leather as claimed. XXXX before the merchandise was delivered and this was a bigger concern as the hardness of the furniture made XXXX very uncomfortable, exacerbating the XXXX condition. 

After the merchant ( XXXX, XXXX Florida ) failed to listen to my concerns about the quality of the furniture and how it also created an uncomfortable environment, I decided to exercise my dispute rights explaining to capital One the reasons. The Capital One Chargeback XXXX case create was # XXXX. 
During the dispute cycle, I uploading several documents to Capital One 's Transaction dispute center. It was also discovered there was hidden damage under the furniture which the merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Florida XXXX failed to address. Pictures of the damage were uploaded to the Capital One Transaction Dispute center as well, but with no response from Capital One. 

In XX/XX/XXXX Capital One found favor with the Merchant and re-billed the charge back. I have paid off the Capital One Balance with the exception of the disputed balance in question. I have closed out the account with the disputed VISA ending in XXXX and have also closed out my other Capital One account. I have asked VISA to investigate Capital One as I do not feel Capital One Honored my dispute rights properly. As of today I do not feel this remaining disputed balance is a legitimate debt due to the quality of furniture and other mitigating circumstances. I do not feel this is a valid debt due to the poor quality and well documented circumstances provided to Capital One. I can be reached at XXXX XXXX XXXX or via email at : XXXXXXXXXXXX

He claimed that people had been calling me for days, which is not at all the case. I went on the Sallie Mae website to ensure my phone number is correct, and it is. My address is also correct, though I have not received any type of correspondence from them. They will not stop calling my husband, even though I 've made payment and my husband is not the loan-holder. They wo n't listen to anything we tell them on the phone ; the only thing the customer service agents will say is, "" You must pay immediately '' and "" How would you like to pay?

This vehicle was purchased with proceeds from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So my obligation to Honda Financial Services ( HFS ) ended and the debt was completely liquidated at that time. I have documents to support this. 
After that fact, HFS paid an amount for vehicle taxes of approximately {$690.00} and sent me a bill. I did not agree that I owed that money to the taxing authority and liquidating that tax debt could undermine my ability to get it corrected by the taxing authority. I believe the tax was calculated incorrectly. Nevertheless I paid HFS but not after they reported me as being 30 days late on the account : an account that was paid in full. I never gave them permission to reopen the credit, nor to pay these fees on my behalf after they had no further right, title or interest in the property. I have been billed separately by the County of XXXX for taxes due on this vehicle. The amount paid by HFS is not a legitimate debt ; is related to a loan that was paid in full and they "" reopened '' the credit, on a non-revolving account without my consent and without lawful authority. I sent a letter with return receipt requested with supporting documentation. The matter was removed from my credit at that time. It has since reappeared, so I asked that it be removed.

09/11/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I submitted an appeal for a repayment Plan to my Mortgage servicer, Plaza Home Mortgage, the bank XXXX. The appeal was because we added income. We are now being told we do not qualify and we can not understand why. We were advised to submit all income in the home for my spouse and myself. We understood that all income would be considered. Originally, I applied with my income only and now we are adding my wife and we do not QUALIFY. How could that be???? 
1.The assumption is that I MAY HAVE NOT QUALIFY in the first place in XXXX 2014 and therefore I am thinking this was predatory lending Plaza Home Mortgage. Which they have been cited for in the past as well XXXX. 
2. Our PMI is at 1.72 % of the loan which does contain {$20000.00} of construction, it is a XXXX streamline loan, so the base loan is XXXX. If I am correct it should be on the base of XXXX and not the XXXX ( which includes the construction loan ). 
3. The rate for the PMI should have been between 1.30 % and 1.55 % for 2014 which is when the loam closed. We are at XXXX of the full loan. 
4. We are advised that a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, would see us face to face because Plaza did not desire to foreclose on us but we never met with the company and after calling Plaza a few time I was never given a number for them, I was told I had to wait for them to come to me. We then received a letter that we were assigned to a law foreclosure group, that was notorious for robo signing of foreclosure mortgages in Florida. 
4. I was laughed at by Plaza Rep when I advised them we are working overtime and such because we wanted to save our home, "" how long are you going to keep that up for '' ( if the conversation was recorded by the company feel free to look into it XXXX by XXXX XXXX. I guess XXXX people should give up and not own property because we lack work ethic is what I gathered from XXXX XXXX, which is why moving forward in XXXX with the additional appeals I felt we would be denied regardless of what we submitted, and here we are now5. The calculations on the property taxes for the 2014 year was suppose to be XXXX divided by XXXX equal XXXX but the XXXX reflects XXXX per month. The new taxes hopefully will be roughly XXXX which would lower our responsibility. 
6. This is a FHA loan, we re paying a premium to insure that the bank suffers no loss if we default. WE in turn get nothing, why would they keep returning our payments, not sending out the representative they promised to help us and kick us out. WE want our home and we are communicating. 
I have ask for a XXXX mortgage forensic audit on this account and will seek legal avenues if we are not accommodated.

06/25/2015,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"- Had to get a new account last year ( 2014 ) due to fraud. 
- I had a line of credit attached to the account that had to be closed, and was denied application for the same line of credit on my new account. 
- XXXX month after closing my account and being sure that all my automatic payments, etc., had been updated, I went to a Citibank branch to close the account. 
- I explicitly asked if my ability to repay the balance on the line of credit would be affected, and was told, definitively, "" No, it would not. "" - The automatic payments that I had setup in those XXXX months from new account stopped processing because the line of credit was closed. 
- When I realized, I called the bank and tried to setup automatic payments again. I was told that they were setup, and I had a XXXX late fees taken back by the bank. 
- Months later, I got a notice stating that I had missed XXXX payments in a row ( did not receive intermittent letters before then ) ; I had n't noticed because ( 1 ) I was told that automatic payments had been setup, and ( 2 ) I no longer have access to the account online so could not check to see if payments were being made, and ( 3 ) did not get a notice from the bank until XXXX payments were missed. I tried to have these late payments taken back, but was denied. 
- It was at this time that I spoke to the collections dept, and was able to negotiate an agreement whereby I made XXXX specific monthly payments that we set up on the spot, and then I would have my account brought back to current, and then I could go about making regular payments again. 
- While paying the debt-collection payments setup by the bank over the phone, i continued to receive late payment charges, even though I was paying EXACTLY according to the plan they setup ( there was literally no other option without me calling to cancel, which did not happen ). 
- Tried to get those late charges taken back, and was denied, despite the fact that it was clearly the bank 's fault. 

This has affected the amount of interest I 'm being charged, my overall balance due to late fees, and my credit score. I would sincerely like to change banks, but the switching costs are prohibitive due to my affected credit score, and my worry that I will not be able to make payments on the closed account with a non-Citibank account.

07/30/2016,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"My social security was offset in XX/XX/XXXX for an outstanding student loan, at a time I was collecting unemployment after a lay-off.from a job. I had just started receiving social security. It was a difficult time, but I kept paying.the offset, even though I never received a letter informing me that I would have a lien in the first place.. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX because I was home taking care of my mother after she had a XXXX. Our financial difficulty was so great, that we barely had enough food at the end of the month. XXXX XXXX told me my student loan went to a company called "" Performant Corp. '' I called Performant Corp and started working with a gentleman named XXXX, a likable customer service representative, who told me he would help me bring my student loan current, and take my social security lien off within six weeks of my first payment. I waited for forms to fill out my income verification information, but they did not arrive in the mail. What arrived instead, was a threatening letter demanding the full payment of the loan. I was shocked. I called XXXX and he said the forms he sent out were returned in the mail, and to ignore the threatening letter. 

He sent out new income verification forms and I filled them out and sent them to him. When I called him again, he said he got the forms.. He told me my social security lien would be lifted after I started making payments. 

I also told him I never received the full history of my student loan payments and loan origination I requested from him. I only received notice of the payments from my social security lien. He said he would look into it. I never heard from him again. 

I am complaining about the way Performant Corp handled my student loan restructuring. 
I called today to try and find out why XXXX had not communicated with me. I did not get to talk to him. I was told by a representative who answered the phone that my loan was sent to another agency, XXXX. When I called XXXX, the customer representative was very helpful, but did not know why my loan was transferred to her. She told me I needed to start the entire process over with her, although she said she could use the e-mail to send out forms to me, instead of making me wait for the mail. ( We have to drive to the post office which is miles away ). 

I am complaining about the way Performant Corp handled the restructuring of my student loan. They did not follow through with the things they told me they would do to help me bring my student loan current, and they did not communicate with me about transferring me to another agency. 

The lien on my social security should have been removed by now. It is hard to be home with a parent who needs around-the-clock care. It is hard to buy her the supplements she needs and to gas the car up to get her to her doctors appointments and to her physical therapy, when I can not go out and make an income to help us get out of poverty. The financial hardship I tried to remedy has worsened for me. 

For years, I have tried to get more information about this loan. It is very difficult to get answers in writing. I believe this Stafford Loan was eligible for forgiveness because I worked in Title I schools teaching, tutoring, and counseling learning-delayed students for many years. 

I ca n't get answers, No one will give me the payment history that goes back to XX/XX/XXXX when I made payments before I suffered lay-offs. I ca n't get a copy of the original loan, and it keeps climbing to insurmountable levels. 

I just came out of a two-year period of XXXX. Should n't my loan be credited? Should n't debtors receive information from creditors, if creditors are demanding information from them? It does not seem to work that way.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Performant Financial Corporation,HI,967XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/03/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2038055

10/13/2015,Bank account or service,Savings account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"On XX/XX/XXXX my mother told me come down to U.S. Bank, I went down to U.S. Bank and was met by my mother and my sister I sat down with the banker and my mother said my father wanted me to have his savings account, her and I were both pay on death of my father 's account. So after XXXX min of paperwork with the banker I was issued a cashiers check for {$41000.00} I then took the cashiers check and opened a new checking and savings account within US Bank in my soul name and deposited the money within the savings account. So then 11 months later after a falling out with my mother in XX/XX/XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX l received a call from US Bank telling me my account has been frozen that my mother had come in to the bank on or about XX/XX/XXXX saying she never got her {$20000.00} and that if I do n't provide proof that my mother has no interest in my account that they will be giving her {$20000.00}. So I contacted the district manager and she informed me that there 's nothing I can do about it and that when my fathers Account was closed the banker did n't do the paperwork right. So I went down to the bank and spoke with them and I repeatedly told them this was my account and it had nothing to do with the previous account that had already been closed this account is only in my name and has no ties to my mother or my deceased father 's previous account. After two weeks of contacting corporate and speaking with countless people and everybody saying that that 's not right that this ca n't happen then told me to speak with the District manager and that it was her decision so, to no avail on XX/XX/XXXX they withdrew {$20000.00} and gave it to my mother. I even opened a case with the XXXX and us banks District managers response was that they will stand by their decision and that they considered this is an error on my account and they have to right to disperse my funds how they see fit and that they were unable to obtain security footage from the day of XX/XX/XXXX which leads me to believe that my mother is saying she was not there when my fathers account was closed? On any pay on death all parties must be present when account is closed she had and was there for his account to be closed I tried to obtain any of the sign documents from the bank but they informed me they do not keep any records and that they do not have any of the signed documents from my fathers account being closed. So all the paperwork my mother and I signed the day of XX/XX/XXXX when my mother had to provide the death certificate to be able to close my father 's account cause my mothers name was n't on my fathers account it was his soul account, they tell me there 's nothing? I do n't understand how there can be no paperwork for an account being closed due to death for {$41000.00}. The paperwork had to be reviewed and signed off by upper management before I could be issued the cashiers check. How is it possible that the bank will allow a person to come back 11 months later and take something that is not theirs. I brought all these things up with the district manager but it fell upon deaf ears. The district manager would not help me all she would tell me is it is unfortunate. I also ask the district manager to refer this to the Superior Court to be heard in civil court but she declined and chose to disperse my funds.

Funny thing is that after they turn us down, they send us a packet saying they want to help us!!!! Now, we have finally found a way to get caught up on our XXXX mortgage, and I called the same bank -- Suntrust -- to get caught up on our home equity loan and they informed us they have charged off the loan because we are five days late. WHAT???? Yet, they accepted a {$300.00} payment last month ( XXXX ), a {$500.00} payment just went out, and I am holding in my hand a bill from them saying our due date is XXXX XXXX. How on earth can a bank charge off a home equity loan without sending out some sort of certified mail notification? I am shocked and disgusted by SunTrust. We have been battling with them for over a year over payments they have returned, causing us to be late ( we have proof from our bank but they wo n't admit they returned the money ) -- we finally caught up and now they are trying to charge off our XXXX when we have been sending money every month and are now literally sitting on the phone trying to get caught up. They are a joke and the whole idea of "" let us work with you and help you keep your home '' is a fraud. I hope the CFPB can help us to hold them accountable for either their stupidity and incompetence or downright inhuman treatment of hardworking people trying to do the right thing.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Bayview responded stating that they suspended the foreclosure process on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and had requested a number of documents for my modification. On around XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I had provided Bayview with all of the requested documents via secure, encrypted e-mail. The account representative, XXXX XXXX confirmed receipt of the documents. 

It was stated that my modification would take up to 90 days to complete. From XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, i had n't heard anything whatsoever from Bayview via mail or e-mail concerning the status of my modification or any missing documents that they may have been in need of. In fear of history repeating itself, I sent XXXX XXXX a follow-up e-mail requesting an update of my modification ( see attached ). I have a tracker on my e-mail that sends me a notification if/when the recipient receives my e-mail. XXXX ( the representative that I was assigned to at Bayview ) received my e-mail that day but chose not to respond. 

From XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I DID NOT receive a single request for more information from Bayview via mail or e-mail, nor did I receive a modification approval or denial. The only notification that I received from Bayview that even gave the implication that my loan modification was denied was a foreclosure notification that arrived via certified mail on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Pursuant to 12 U.S. Code 5219a, Bayfiew was supposed to provide me with a denial notification along with other required data. Bayview failed to do so. 

Upon receipt of that foreclosure notification, I sent XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and the Hamp Esculations e-mail that was provided in BOTH complaints that have been filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that e-mail, I also placed a tracker to ensure that all parties received it. It was reported that both XXXX XXXX received my e-mail shortly after I sent it but neither of them responded. I did n't expect XXXX to respond because when she went on leave, my file was assigned to XXXX XXXX. However, because XXXX was still my case manager, I expected a response from here. Unfortunately, I did n't so I then called Bayview and attempted to speak with XXXX XXXX. When XXXX got on the phone, I advised her that we were on a recorded line and provided her with my name and phone number. To my surprise, although Bayview states on virtually every call that they are monitored and/or recorded, XXXX REFUSED to proceed with the call to discuss what had taken place with the file. She told me that I had to call her from a different phone. I asked XXXX why she had n't responded to my e-mail and she emphatically denied ever receiving an e-mail from me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX requesting status of my modification. 

Because of my history with Bayview, I did n't feel comfortable with having that type of conversation without being on a recorded line so we disconnected the call and I followed up with an e-mail. Once again, I placed a tracker on that e-mail to confirm that XXXX XXXX of Bayview Loan Servicing received my e-mail. This time, I received a "" Not Read '' notification from Bayview which generally means that XXXX deleted the e-mail without even reviewing it so that she could properly address my concerns. 

I 've waited 72 hours for XXXX XXXX to send me an e-mail with information on what happened to my loan modification and she has absolutely refused to respond to me. This behavior is unacceptable and is discriminatory.

I was told by a representative that answered their XXXX number on the back of my credit card that the charge would be credited as this was a perk of my Platinum Optima card. I made this call because it was n't clear from their website which cards were included in this perk. After receiving my bill with the {$85.00} charge and no credit I called again to ask when I could expect the credit. I was told to wait a week or so while a supervisor investigates my claim. About a week later I received a voicemail from the supervisor stating that there was no record of my original call and therefore I would not receive my credit since I was incorrectly told it was covered on my card. I immediately call and talked to XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX. He also stated that due to no record they would do nothing to credit my account. I made this purchase on this card based on the fact the I confirmed with AMEX that it would be a credited charge. I did not dream or imagine that this call happened, and while I wo n't profess to understand how their call log system works, I talked to a live AMEX rep, was put on hold while she confirmed the perk with her supervisor, and was then told that the charge would be credited and to go ahead with the charge. I have been a perfect customer for years and am livid that AMEX would not stand behind what its representative say, and that they would expect a good customer to pay for a failure on their end. While I 'm sure their systems are generally accurate, their failure to record my first communication with them, and their denial of it happening, is essentially the same as calling me a liar and holding me accountable to pay for their mistake, which I refuse to do.

NOW as of today when I went to go to make my online payment, XXXX XXXX informs me that my loan will now be serviced by another company. I regret 100 % refinancing with this company, I get harassed every week by this company, despite the fact I have physical paper work confirming my account. Can you please let me know who I can complain to or who I can go over my mortgage paper work to see if my refinance was done correctly?! Any help will be greatly appreciated!

A hold is just what it means, hold, in short it will not be available to you to spend, they can hold it for a day, week, and longer. 
Do n't worry if it 's a {$20.00} check it will most likely run its course and will be ready for your use within a day, or sometimes that same day. 
Summary ; I made a deposit on the XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo placed a hold on the check until the XXXX of XXXX, not a big deal but it is a little more than {$3000.00}, I need this money to pay bills such as health insurance, utilities and so on. Mind you that Wells Fargo cashed the check and have withdrawn the amount from the bank from which it was wrote. The individual that wrote the check I had called her and asked if she had put a hold on the check and she said no, looked it up on her account and Wells had taken the money from her account on the XXXX of XXXX, 2015. 
Although Wells Fargo is legal in what they are doing but think holding a check for weeks is not right, they are using my money while I sit here and ca n't do a darn thing about it but wait. My insurance will be cancelled, power will be shut off, do n't have money for groceries, pay credit card and so on, this is unreal, banks although legal, and they are greedy and not very responsive to customer needs. 
In short you are at their mercy until they decide the time is right, one would have to assume they must be cooking their books if they need to place holds on checks so they can use the money for their own issues. 
I can only recommend you do n't deposit large checks into any Wells Fargo checking, and or savings account. You may not have access to this money until such time they ( Wells Fargo ) can reconcile their books. 
Last note my account is in excellent standing, and have never had a bad check deposit! 
Very Sadly, Well Fargo Customer

I deposited {$2500.00} to open the account, which I thought was a simple checking account. The business was in my son 's name and registered in the State of XXXX, I live in XXXX. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I went into the local Wells Fargo branch and met with a Banker to remove my name from the checking account and leave it solely in my son 's name. I completed the paperwork with the Banker and thought that would be my last involvement with the account. 
About the 3rd week of XXXX XXXX, I received a call from my son in XXXX stating that Wells Fargo had contacted him regarding his outstanding balance of over {$9000.00} and that I was personally responsible for the balance which was on a credit card tied to the checking account. I never signed up for a credit card on the checking account and had removed my name from the account 9 months earlier. 
The final result of this was that Wells Fargo charged {$1300.00} in overdraft fees and almost {$1900.00} in finance charges in the approximately 9 months that the account was supposedly in the hands of my son. Wells Fargo came after me for the $ XXXX and eventually I agreed to pay {$9000.00} to avoid the ongoing monthly charges and the ding to my credit each month. 

They said I agreed to this credit card on the checking account and that when I removed myself from the checking account I should have also told them that I wanted myself removed from the credit card. How could I possibly ask to do that when I did n't even know there was a credit card attached to the checking account? Should n't the Banker I worked with to remove my name in XXXX XXXX have told me that there was a credit card attached to the account and that I was responsible for any activity in spite of removing my name from the account? 
I feel I was told to sign things which were not explained to me and should not have been responsible for anything more than a simple checking account with an initial deposit of {$2500.00}. 
I plead my case with the local branch manager, the local District Manager and his Boss in XXXX and was told I had signed the forms and I was responsible, no negotiation.

05/05/2016,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"I have had issues with American Express customer service on my American Express SPG Preferred Card. The core issue was very simple - one of fraud concerns, and American Express needing to verify my identity. I respect and acknowledge that credit card companies should take all necessary steps to ensure my identity is not compromised. However, there were a couple key lapses in customer service which has made my experience extremely frustrating. 
First, the customer service department has repeatedly shown a lack of respect for my time. I have stressed to the customer service department that there are only a few windows when I can attend to this issue, since I have a full time job. I requested that, before trying to call me on the phone, they schedule a time to speak. So far, I have been promised phone calls at four separate time slots, usually at about XXXX Eastern Time ( since I can ensure that I am near my phone then, after the work day ends ). American Express has NEVER called me back at the scheduled time. Instead, customer service calls when I am in lunch meetings, or in a meeting with my boss, or occasionally when I am trying to rush work in the afternoon. Despite repeated assurances that they will honor the next appointment, I have not once gotten a call at a scheduled time. In addition, some of these calls just have not taken place at all. I waited about two weeks for a call from the fraud protection service, after being told it would take two days for them to respond. There was no phone call. Since the customer service department could reach me, it is absolutely baffling that another department could not. My conclusion is that the company simply does not value my time, or keeping to appointments. 
Second, the consumer care professionals have been unable to answer basic queries, and have not taken the time to review the case, forcing me to go through a lengthy process of repeating myself every time I contact them. The first time I contacted them, I did so late at night, since this was the only time I could attend to the issue. However, after navigating several robot menus, and waiting on the line for another five to ten minutes, I received a message that the department I was trying to reach was closed. When the online customer service assured me it would be open, I called at least XXXX or XXXX numbers, only to find that all these departments were closed. The customer service online repeatedly insisted that the departments would be open. Only after finally speaking to a manager was she able to transfer me to a department which knew that the department I was actually trying to reach was closed. The process took about 3 hours. I have gotten increasingly frustrated with this process over the weeks I have been in contact with American Express, and have asked their customer service department to come up with a solution such that I can find a convenient way to verify my identity without having to travel out of the office. When they finally do contact me the customer service representative puts me on hold for XXXX minutes while reviewing my case, then refers me to another department. In many cases, I have had to repeat my case again. 

Third, they have not proposed solutions to genuine issues, merely citing procedure. The fraud team said it would call to verify my identity. It either did not make this call, or made it at an inappropriate time when I could not answer. However, they made no effort to contact me via any other means. They have since asked me to travel to a notary to get my information notarized. As I am travelling, I do not have time to make this trip within the time limit they have stipulated. I was simply told that the card would then be cancelled. When I raised a concern that the promotion I signed up for might have expired by the time I resolved these issues, I was told there would be no compensation.",,Amex,DC,200XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/05/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1912676
12/10/2015,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,No notice of investigation status/result,"I have filed numerous complaints and disputes with Transunion, and as a monthly subscriber to their credit services, I have to say that I 'm appalled by their level of paying-customer service, much less attention to the needs of the consumer. Once they open an investigation, it essentially FREEZES the entire credit report during the dispute process, which takes approx. 30 days for each dispute. This means, that even though I have daily access to view updated credit reports, they information is static. 
On 10+ occasions during the past month, I have contacted them concerning an account to which I was listed as an "" authorized user ''. This account was supposed to be removed over XXXX days ago, but they have failed to remove it. This past occurrence, I was instructed on XXXX XXXX that I would need to dispute the information directly with the creditor and file a dispute with Transunion. I did just that, and now they are approximately 20+ days into that dispute and have not contacted the creditor once. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with several departments within the creditor, and they assured me that nobody from ANY credit agency has contacted them, much less Transunion. 
I 've attempted to upload files to their dispute process, but since my report/file is completely frozen, it is impossible to do so. I 've tried faxing in supporting documents to the number they provided, but the fax # has been busy for 10 straight days. I 've tried calling them to request an email address I can send supporting documents to, and they attempt to convince me that nobody in their company has an email address. 
To date, I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card ( XXXX the same place ) and have removed myself as an authorized user for the account. My wife is the only person financially responsible for this account, and I have supporting documents to show this removal. I 've attempted to have this resolved quickly by Transunion, but they seem content to not do anything in terms of an actual investigation and are failing service expectations miserably.

01/25/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"On three separate occasions, the dates being XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I disputed the following accounts with Transunion : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I informed Transunion that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681g I have the right to demand that they disclose to me all of the documents they have recorded and retained in their file at the time of these requests concerning the accounts that they are reporting in my credit report and requested copies of the documents they used to verify the accuracy of the disputed accounts. 

I informed Transunion that if they do not have any documentation in their files that verify the accuracy of these disputed accounts that under Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ( i ) they are required to delete them immediately. I also referenced FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which states that all unverified accounts must be promptly deleted. 

Transunion responded by stating that the data furnisher verified that the disputed information was accurate as reported. I then disputed these accounts directly with XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, which claims to service these accounts for XXXX XXXX, responded but failed to provide the validation I requested pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ). I sent a follow up dispute on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

Resurgent Capital Services, in a response dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX to CFPB Case # XXXX, stated : "" Resurgent did not provide validation of debt in response to your XXXX XXXX, XXXX request for accounts ending in XXXX and XXXX due to the fact that your letter requested that we cease contact with you. Accordingly, these accounts were placed in a cease status, which resulted in no further contact, written or otherwise, from XXXX ''. My letters to XXXX ( XXXX ) stated : "" Please limit all future communication with me to writing only ''. 

In a response dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX to CFPB XXXX # XXXX, XXXX admitted that they could not validate XXXX of the debts when they stated : "" XXXX is in receipt of additional supporting documentation for XXXX accounts referenced in your dispute. '' This proves they did not have the validation when it was requested, which also proves that Transunion failed to properly investigate these accounts when I originally disputed them. 

Since XXXX XXXX could not validate the accounts, Transunion could not have conducted a reasonable reinvestigation to verify the accuracy of the disputed information. The FCRA clearly states that a credit reporting agency must "" verify '' that these items are being "" reported correctly ''. I asked for proof of verification but Transunion relied solely on hearsay information from the information source and shifted the burden back to me to contact the original creditor to verify these accounts, which is clearly in violation of 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). 

XXXX v. Trans Union Corp., XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) states that the FCRA requires a credit reporting agency to go beyond its original sources of credit information when reinvestigating inaccuracies in a credit report after the consumer informs the agency of those inaccuracies. Transunion did not do this. Since the CFPB is the enforcement arm of the FCRA and FDCPA, I request you investigate this matter and compel Transunion to obey the law.

During this time we were unable to sell our home and it was foreclosed upon. At the same time I filed for Bankruptcy that which included the line of credit loan, which appeared to have been assigned to a XXXX law firm XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Subsequently my children and I moved back to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX area ) in XXXX XXXX and continued to pay the BK amount for the year. Subsequently, I received a letter which informed me I was not paying enough and the BK was being withdrawn. The amount owed for the WFB account was XXXX {$33000.00} ( which is confirmed on the XXXX website ). In XXXX, I received a letter from a XXXX court informing me a court order of garnishment for XXXX {$100000.00}. I have requested an accounting of the amount they have listed to validate/confirm the amount. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX letters have been sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX without any response. 

There are several issues that are quite unclear. 
How can a court rule without notifying me of a hearing date and then pass judgement? 
How did the outstanding amount go from XXXX {$33000.00} to XXXX {$100000.00}? 
Why have they not provided me with an accounting? 
I do not live in XXXX and have not for several years, should this not be handled in a court XXXX? 
When I moved to XXXX the court that handled the case was in XXXX and the reason I was given was because this is my place of residence. Now that my place of residence is XXXX should it not also be handled in the state of residency.

07/24/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I opened a New CitiGold Checking Account online http : //www.offer.citibank.com/ with a promotional code XXXX for a bonus offer. The bonuses offered XXXX AAdvantage bonus miles in exchange for opening a CitiGold account and set up a bill payment for at least 2 consecutive months, and make at least {$1000.00} in debit card purchases. 
I called Citigold right after I applied the account on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to ensure that I am eligible for receiving the XXXX AAdvantage bonus miles, I confirmed with a representative from Citi that the promotion was linked to my account and completion of the requirements would make me eligible for the promotion. I met the requirements XXXX/XXXX/2016. I was asked to provide my XXXX XXXX account number to Citi so they would be able to credit the miles. 
When the miles had not posted a few days after the XXXX, 2016 statement, on XXXX/XXXX/2016, I called Citi to follow up on receiving my miles, The Citigold representative confirmed that I had indeed completed all requirements associated with the aforementioned promotion code, and that, per the terms and conditions of the offer, I would receive the miles 90 days from the end of the statement cycle in which the requirements were completed. 
However I was then informed by Citi on XXXX/XXXX/2016 that I was not eligible for the promotion since "" There was not a promotion offered in conjunction with the opening of your account '' ( see attachment ). 
As stated above, I met Citi 's requirements and was eligible for the promotion as I was adhering to their terms and conditions for the promotion. I do not appreciate their continued willful denial of these terms, and their refusal to award me the points I have earned, all while I still keep an outstanding balance in Citigold account per their request to avoid the monthly fee. 
This letter contradicts all discussions I had with Citi at the time I opened the account and at activation. I would not have opened the bank account with Citibank if it was not for this promotion. I am requesting Citi to honor the set promotion. If I was indeed not targeted for the promotion, Citi should have rejected my application for opening the new account using the promo code. And not do it when I have opened the account, met all the necessary requirements and when it comes time to pay out the bonus. It has been weeks of dealing with this and I am very disappointed that Citi would mislead and treat their customers in this manner. 
I am a consumer who has been a good customer of theirs and has never missed payment on any of my services with them. Their denial of this promotion to me, despite their own employees confirming I was eligible prior, feels like a bait and switch tactic. I am turning to the CFPB as I feel I have no other resources.

After a month long stay in a rehabilitation center, my brother and I arranged for him to be moved to an assisted living facility. When it became clear that he would be unable to return to his home, my dad asked me to initiate the process of giving the house back to WFHM by means of deed in lieu of foreclosure, as the house was worth what was owed on it. 
I called XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that I needed to fax my Power of Attorney to them. I did so and waited. While we were waiting my dad fell and broke his leg - requiring another hospital and rehab stay. While he was hospitalized, I received a letter stating that my POA was not acceptable to WFHM. I called again and was told to type a letter for my dad to sign, giving WFHM permission to deal with me. Again, I did as requested and sent the letter to my brother to have our dad sign. Unfortunately, he had taken a turn for the worse and neither my brother nor I felt comfortable asking our dad to sign a letter he was incapable of comprehending. Once again, I called WFHM and explained the circumstances. I was told not to worry, that we had a year from the date the house was vacated to give it back. 
My dad passed away XX/XX/XXXX - a Saturday evening. First thing, Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called WFHM to inform them of my father 's death. I was told that I would receive a letter from one of their "" Home Preservation Specialists ''. I received the letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called the phone number listed numerous times and always got either the woman 's voice mail or a message stating that her mailbox was full. I easily left her 30 voice mails and never heard back from her. I called the number one last time and opted to speak with a customer service representative. I was told to fax my parent 's death certificates and a copy of the will - of which I am the executrix. I took the documents to a local WF branch and a banker faxed them for me. Again, I waited ... 
A few weeks later, I had to go to the bank on another matter and mentioned my frustration to the banker. He gave me a phone number for their resolution department. I called, explained my problem and was assigned a different HSP. The gentleman with whom I spoke asked me what I wanted. I explained that our parents were being interred XX/XX/XXXX and I would like to give the house back the next day. This gave my brother and me a chance to inspect the property. 
I was told to write a letter explaining what I wanted to do and fax it to WFHM. I did so, and a week later it was rejected. Back to the bank I went and the banker called for me. I asked the woman to state VERBATIM what needed to be written. Again, the latter was rejected - this time I found out because my XXXX HPS had FINALLY returned my calls. She needed me to add one phrase to the letter and re-fax it. She also promised to call me XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have not heard from her ... 
In the meantime, I received 12 letters ( 8 Certified Mail ) from a law firm stating that the house was to be sold at a foreclosure sale XX/XX/XXXX. I called the law firm and wrote them a letter explaining my ordeal. I also filed a complaint with the XXXX. Two days later, I heard from the WFHM resolution department. I was told I had to open probate. This was the first I had heard of probate and I said if that had to be done, WFHM was paying for it, as there was no more money in my dad 's estate and I was NOT paying for it.

He postponed them through XXXX, which is the XXXX party vendor that was debiting his account. He thought this was enough as he had limited financial experience. To our dismay on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Chase took the truck stating he was only XXXX payments behind. XXXX was holding on to XXXX payment to send to Chase and he was ready to make the next payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and he would be caught up. Numerous calls were made to Chase to explain the unfortunate situation in which they offered no support. They entered into a loan unfairly and then decided to ruin a child 's future with bad credit instead of working with him to keep the vehicle and yes he was only XXXX payments behind to be caught up in 3 days. The only option Chase is giving now is to refinance the truck when we just want to keep and pay the loan directly to them, even offered a monthly auto debit from his account. Why would Chase take such a hard stance on a child when they should never have done the loan to begin with. On my end I taught my son a lesson and he is prepared to pay the vehicle on time every month and accept his responsibility and Chase will not give him the option. I work for another financial institution and 2 months behind is not enough to seize property. Seems to me Chase wants out of the loan that was done unfairly to over their end and I want them to admit the error and allow him to keep his vehicle and pay his debt.

I immediately telephoned my bank and was told by the first representative, who was in XXXX XXXX, that I should contact the vendor about these charges. I was appalled that I was not referred to the Fraud Department and instead was told that until the charges left the Pending category and moved into Posted that I would not be able to dispute the charges. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX of the charges have posted. I again called the bank and was referred to Disputes. I was also told that it would take 10 business days to return my funds to my account. I would like to file a complaint because I feel this is extremely unfair that a consumer must follow rules and regulations that are obviously in favor of the banking institution. My bank gets to float on my money. I find this unacceptable. When I use my debit card, charges are immediately taken out of my account. If I get a credit for charges placed on my debit card the bank gets to float on my money until they decide to return said funds. Again, I must complain that this is unfair to the consumer, me, and I want to make a formal complaint.

Note on stmt that starting XX/XX/XXXX new amt. due will be {$1100.00} and a separate letter will be sent explaining. This new amt due is the result of us demanding OCWEN reassess our escrow since our taxes were reduced and after many months complaining this was supposed to be the result ... lower monthly pymt. 
We paid {$1200.00} for XXXX due date. 

2.XX/XX/XXXX regular mortgage stmt due XXXX, showed new amt. due = {$1100.00}, again a note on stmt that starting XX/XX/XXXX new amt. due will be {$1100.00} and a separate letter will be sent explaining. Never rec 'd a letter. We paid {$1100.00} for XXXX due date. 

3. XX/XX/XXXX - statement was all wrong. 
a. Due date should have been XXXX, it said XXXX - only 4 days later. This never happened before. 
b.stated amt. due was {$1200.00} - wrong - it was supposed to be {$1100.00} as per previous XXXX stmts. 
c.Showed they cashed our {$1100.00} and applied to principle only - not XXXX pymt which we did not authorize, was their mistake, and never done before. 
d. They now expected us to pay {$1200.00} backdated to XXXX in order to be considered current. 
4. Called XXXX -the date we got stmt in the mail -and spent over XXXX minutes with XXXX different cust.svc. reps with no satisfaction. They did not acknowledge it was their mistake, continued to state we still owed XXXX pymt, they could not correct their mistake of applying to principle only, and could not prevent reporting to credit agency if we did n't pay extra pymt. I demanded to speak to supv, was placed on hold, then told they would call be back within XXXX hours, which they never did and I have a phone record to prove it. 

During these calls I also demanded a new escrow evaluation since they told us in XX/XX/XXXX that their analysis in XXXX was wrong and they would re-evaluate it XX/XX/XXXX and mail the new results. I called XX/XX/XXXX since we never received the new escrow analysis and they said they would send it. They never did. I finally rec 'd a copy on XXXX - after these phone calls. 
Also, in separate letter, received escrow refund check for {$1700.00} with no explanation after these calls. 

5. XXXX called - automated message said {$1100.00} was due which was the correct amount so assumed maybe they fixed the problems. 

6. XXXX regular mortgage stmt due XXXX stated we owed XXXX payments = {$2400.00} and that the new mortgage pymt of {$1100.00} was going to start XX/XX/XXXX and a letter would be sent to explain. We called again, again spoke with several cust svc reps who did nothing but ask for us to pay our mortgage over the phone with a credit card, or at least pay the late fees over the phone with a credit card. We demanded a supv. and they said they would have to call us back within XXXX hours. 
7. They did call back the next day but missed us. We called them, and were told the same thing - they would not fix the problem, they do not acknowledge it as their mistake, if we do not pay 2 months of mortgage they will report it to credit agencies and charge late fees. 

7. XXXX received certified letter from OCWEN stating we were past due in our XXXX mortgage pymt in the amt of {$1200.00} + XXXX late fee. 

8. At this point we are afraid that any money we send they will apply to principle and we will never be considered current and our perfect credit that we have worked hard for will be ruined. Their practices of back billing for their mistakes, not correcting accounting mistakes, and then double billing the client are unethical. Their threats to report to credit agencies is unethical and bullying in light of the problem originating from their accounting mistake. They held on to escrow funds much longer than reasonable and only responded when threatened several times - indicating possible mishandling of escrow monies. We are unlikely to be the only customers affected by these practices.

I can not tell you how frustrating this is as a consumer. We have been racing against the clock to refinance our XXXX homeloans and have been stalled twice now by XXXX 's reporting of late payments. Like many consumers concerned about late payment reporting, we consistently set up automatic payments and bank withdrawals with our lenders to avoid this very thing, however, XXXX 's online auto-pay sign up system has failed on numerous occasions XX/XX/XXXX without alerting me that the auto-pay function was not available to set up online. 
I then phoned XX/XX/XXXX to ask for auto-pay to be set up and paperwork was supposedly sent to me to do so. The forms never arrived and as a result, our XXXX payment was made after the due date further affecting our credit report. I followed up to ask for the paperwork again, which did finally arrive in XXXX. I completed the forms and returned to Clearspring and never heard back. 
XX/XX/XXXX I phoned XXXX to ensure that the payment would be made on time and found out that my auto-pay request had been denied. No one had attempted to contact me to inform me of that or why. During that phone call, I found our that XXXX declared my requested withdrawal date XXXX the XXXX of the month ) to be too far after the payment due date. What they did n't consider, for some reason, was that I was actually requesting the XXXX of the PRIOR month to be the withdrawal date to be extra precautious and to spread one of our automatic payments to a different time of the month. 
I am concerned that business practices at Acqura/XXXX place a too-high burden on its customers for making consistent, timely payments. At the same time, the company 's erroneous record-keeping and reporting are damaging people 's lives and threatening to further erode the slow gains the nation 's economy is making.

10/18/2016,Consumer Loan,Installment loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"I had a personal loan with Best Egg that I originated online and paid automatically on a monthly basis through my checking account. About one year into the 36-month term of the loan, we refinanced our home, and the lender added a condition that the Best Egg loan balance must be paid out of escrow funds before our refinance would close. 

On the day the refi was funded - XX/XX/2016 - the escrow agent called Best Egg and attempted to make a payment. He offered to do a wire transfer and was told that it would not be acceptable. He offered to do an ACH payment and was told it would not be acceptable. He even offered - with my blessing - to log into my Best Egg account and initiate a payoff from there. He was then told that all of these options would be unacceptable, and the only way that Best Egg would accept a payoff was via check, mailed to their address. 

Here 's what Best Egg did not say : They charge daily interest, so every day that goes by without receiving my payoff, they charge me more money. Each day, almost {$10.00} - I believe it was {$9.00} to be exact - was added to the loan balance. So they did n't receive and credit my payoff until XX/XX/2016, resulting in {$39.00} in extra charges to me. I feel that this is unacceptable and almost fraudulent - they engineered a process by which they could tack on a few extra days ' interest to every single loan payoff, and did n't even have the courtesy to tell the escrow agent that this is what would happen. As a result, they never considered my account paid off - rather, they now consider it to be delinquent with this minor and ever-increasing interest balance. 

I contacted Best Egg this morning, XX/XX/2016 and spoke with "" XXXX. '' XXXX informed me that they are unwilling or unable to adjust the interest charges, and this is just how their process works. Despite being fully able to take electronic payments on a monthly basis from my checking account, electronic payoffs just are n't allowed because - XXXX 's words - "" our systems just ca n't handle it. '' So apparently I 'm supposed to pay this extra interest, based on a payoff date of XX/XX/XXXX, even though my agent was on the phone XXXX days earlier offering up numerous electronic payment options?

I have been told several things about lowering my bill all have been different from the last. I am unable to pay the insane monthly payment of {$1300.00} they said they could lower to just interest payments at {$1000.00} something. I was told they could even lower that but I would have to wait until my bill is 1 day past due or more so I would be in default then they could lower my payments. I asked if they could just do it now and the last XXXX people have told me that I have to skip a payment in order to do that. The first person said I could lower it to only {$700.00} a month for the first 12 months which would help out the most but now they are saying not guarantees and that I can not even be assessed for that until I am past due. They are charging extremely high interest rate ( 12-14 % ) and I do not even remember agreeing to those high of terms. Something seems very off about the whole thing and process they are taking. I talked to them about doing a debt settlement because i had contacted a law firm, XXXX XXXX, and the debt settlement payments would only be {$1000.00} a month so way lower than Navient. All of my loans were done through XXXX XXXX and now it says Navient.

I must remind you that in my previous letter I requested the following information : ( 1 ) The amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) Provide a verification or copy of any judgment ( if applicable ) ; ( 4 ) Proof that you are licensed to collect debts in ( insert name of your state ) ( 5 ) Provide the actual Bills Statements ( 6 ) Payment Receive I also requested that if you have reported me to any credit reporting agency, that you inform them that I have placed this debt in dispute and to provide me with proof that you have done so. Furthermore, I asked that you immediately send a copy of that dispute letter to the company ( creditor ) that you say I owe money so they are also aware of my dispute with this debt. 
As of today, you have failed to respond to my requests! For your convenience, I have included a copy of my previous letter and a copy of the mail receipt showing that you received my letter on { insert date from mail receipt }. 
Since you have failed to respond I assume that you have been unable to validate the debt and therefore, I consider this matter closed. You may consider this letter your official notification that I do not intend to correspond with you on this matter again unless you comply with my requests, the FDCPA and the FCRA. 

I must remind you that any attempt to collect this debt without validating it, violates the FDCPA and that I am recording all phone calls and keeping all correspondence concerning this matter.

02/22/2016,Credit card,,Closing/Cancelling account,,"Mid to late XXXX, I wanted to trade my car in so I checked my credit to see what kind of rate I might get. I noticed that there was a hard inquiry on my report listed by Capital One. I found the inquiry alarming because I was dealing with fraud where an individual opened up a XXXX XXXX account using my name and social security number and I was receiving letters regarding car loan applications I never applied for! The Capital One inquiry showed up one month after I opened up a XXXX credit card. I 've been with Capital One for years, I have a checking, savings, Platinum, and XXXX card which were all in excellent standing. I contacted "" All Clear '' my credit monitoring service to assist me with the matter. XXXX the representative from "" All Clear '' and I contacted Capital One to inform them of their error. We were able to speak with a representative in Capital One 's fraud department and explained that there was a hard inquiry showing upon my report one month after I opened my XXXX card. I opened my XXXX card ending in XXXX, in XXXX of 2014, that inquiry hit the credit bureaus on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The erroneous inquiry showed up on my report with the date XXXX XXXX, 2014. After explaining the situation to the representative, it was clear there was either a clerical error or fraudent activity happen. The representative said that they would pull my initial application and check what was on file and see if there was a second application for the date in question. We were asked to follow up in a week or so. XXXX and I followed up a week after the initial contact with Capital One and their fraud department and were told that the application had not been pulled, but they believed it was a clerical error and they would more than likely remove the inquiry from my report, but it was a different department which handles that. We checked in several times after seeking status on our request, only to be transfer to XXXX incompetent person after another. We were told that this is a fraud case now and Capital One restricted and suspended both of the credit cards I have for years and paid promptly on! I received a letter in the mail stating the card ending I pin XXXX, was now closed due to fraudent activity! What!!!! They removed the incorrect inquiry on my credit report, and left the XXXX XXXX, 2014 inquiry on my report. Thank about incompetence. Later realizing the gervious errors they made instead of apologizing they made they changed my card number which was in good standing to a different number. They said they would not issue me another card, but would leave this card open for payment and if I wanted the card reinstated paperwork would follow ( which it did ) that I would have to fill out and have notary stamp and witness. This was their mistake no thank you, I do n't want any of your products. XXXX and I called Capital One weekly almost on a daily basis to get some resolve and recourse for the problem they have caused with no avail!! To add insult to injury along with no call backs from a supervisor, they are reporting me late on my credit report on a card account that does not mine. Please help me!!!

Since I am unemployed and no longer in school, there are no frequent activities made by me such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers etc. On XXXX XXXX, I was notified by my mother that I received an email from Wells Fargo stating my online log-in information ( ID and password ) had been changed.

Amazingly, this account has never ever held that amount of moneys. I could not imagine any institution paying out that amount. I was a college student and had recently graduated. I called and after being transferred several times, spoke with XXXX. I filed a claim and stated I should hear something withing 5 business days.

I telephoned on XXXX XXXX, again transferred numerous times. Finally connected to XXXX of Loss Prevention. I had to summarize the situation. I asked did she see the communication with XXXX.

There was a physical withdrawal in the amount of {$300.00} that needs to be satisfied and you as the account holder is responsible. '' It was then that I stated, "" why? '' She emphatically stated that "" you had to give your card and PIN to someone. '' No, I did not. XXXX ( Wells Fargo Rep ) refuted my "" no ''.

08/09/2016,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We have had an active short sale offer on this property since XXXX/XXXX/16. After sending the package to Nationstar and becoming active in XXXX, we met every demand of Nationstar. The appraisal was completed on XXXX/XXXX/16 and came back with the value of {$26000.00}. However, because the XXXX came back at {$64000.00}, we were told that Nationstar would be ordering an additional appraisal to back up the first. We were subsequently told that the XXXX is actually {$84000.00} which we find to be high suspect considering the fair market value is at {$26000.00} per the appraisal and the previous XXXX of {$64000.00}. At this time, we were 15 days away from the Foreclosure Sale Date of XXXX/XXXX/2016. Our office faxed in an escalation request with Nationstar to get the Foreclosure stopped since we had an active buyer. 

Unfortunately due to lack of motion and efforts within Nationstar to protect the best interest of the FHA, Nationstar refused to stop the foreclosure sale ; therefore, we had to hire a lawyer instead to stop the FC date. The day before the original FC sale date, the XXXX was issued and our buyer raised their offer to {$27000.00} in order to exceed the required net of {$21000.00} which was requested by XXXX XXXX at Nationstar. Nationstar claimed orgininal contract was invalid due to the date of inception, therefore, the contract was redrawn. Since this date, we have been waiting for approval from Nationstar while checking in regularly. There have been 3 separate claims that Nationstar was asking for a variance on the XXXX v Appraisal values. Today we were told that the seller needs to bring the property to a marketable status before the FHA will review for a short sale. Our firm has processed XXXX of short sales over the last 7 years and never had a servicer demand that a property be rehabbed in order for the short sale to be completed. We know of no mortgee letter issued that highlights this update procedure and/or policy of the FHA. 

It is our opinion that Nationstar is deliberately trying to foreclose on our client and that they are taking every opportunity possible to derail the short sale. We believe we have identified a trend within Nationstar 's servicing practices. We believe the pattern is as follows : Nationstar drags a property through the short sale process thus determining its real market value, its fake market value, and its future appraised value. These costs are covered by the FHA and not by the servicer. From this point, Nationstar does what it can to deny the short sale, foreclose on a property, send that same property to their auction site XXXX, and charge a 5 % buyer 's premium. In addition, Nationstar receives a servicing fee from the FHA and receives revenue from the vendors who are advertising and/or participating in the auction process. Nationstar benefits much more through this auction process than through a short sale process so they are forcing their borrowers into foreclosure instead of letting them out of the debt. This not only hurts the homeowners but the tax payers and the real estate market as well. 

A complete Short Sale Package including : pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements, is available immediately upon request.",,Nationstar Mortgage,IL,622XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/11/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2053684

Now i have to submit my payment by cash only i went in on XXXX to make a payment with {$440.00} for my payment of {$430.00}. The clerk misplaced or took {$200.00} of my payment making me late for the month payment. Advising the bank of the issue they proceeded to tell me that because of the way i look i am not trustworthy. To me this is not the proper way you treat customers and i have advised everyone to stay away from this bank. I feel like i was discriminated against due to the fact that i was a single girl that wears hoodies and jeans and not because i did not go into the bank with a suit on or dress.

We received a letter for your amazon account for a settlement of XXXX over 3 installments. I had JUST received a health insurance stipend at work and I wanted to take advantage of this ASAP.

This made no sense to me. I was just trying to make a payment. I then called back and spoke with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX who said he would only take the payment in full and basically there was no letter sent. His supervisor also refused to honor the letter. I advised them That I had enough to do a XXXX % settlement in full If they were willing to do that. They refused any wettlement on the account and would not accept any payment. At that point I advised them I would file this complaint they did not seem to care. 
The next day I called back and spoke with a XXXX XXXX I believe. I honestly do not remember his name. We advised me that since I did not set up the payment arrangement the day before the settlement went up to XXXX. The fact is that I did try to make a payment the day before with XXXX reps and they would not take my payment. Why would the bank issue a letter and say one thing and it mean is n't even true.

Also, the utilities can not be turned on to provide an inspection, because the repairs have to be done first, which there is an estimate that was provided as well. Contour Mortgage is also asking that the new estimates they want, MUST come from contractors that hold a valid license and XXXX policy and have Contractor Identity of Interest Certification etc, etc, etc. So, the requested documents I needed to provide went from XXXX to XXXX in a matter of a couple days. I am able to provide a PDF copy of the final demands that Contour Mortgage is requesting. All the information they are asking for was information they had in hand at the beginning phase of this loan application. I am upset they have me jumping through hoops that seem to never end. I can not seem to satisfy the underwriters requests. I have read others reports on the XXXX web site and found there have been others who are dissatisfied with Contour Mortgage Company. My realtor and I have been transparent through this process, but when we ask questions and demand answers, Contour Mortgage employees never answer, never return emails or phone calls or simply put, do n't have the answers, other than a XXXX loan has many steps.

I do n't believe anyone thus far at SPS has properly handled my file. I became XXXX in XXXX as I was in an accident XXXX. I entrusted my brother to make my mortgage payments for me with my fixed income and he did not do that ; instead pocketed my money. If I had n't been XXXX, I would have never become behind at all. 

Seconly, I am disputing the erroneous information contained in SPS ' most recent denial letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, stating my property value is currently {$430000.00}. My property is nowhere near worth that amount and I have attached my own appraisal showing the true value of {$310000.00}, which I paid for from my own funds because I believe so highly that SPS is using an extremely inflated property valuation. I would truly appreciate it if somebody could formally re-review my package using the correct value of {$310000.00}. It should also be noted that I had sent this appraisal with my resubmission packet back in XXXX XXXX, but it seems that it was disregarded by SPS completely. I XXXX have spent money on this that I am trying to save for my mortgage if I get approved. It was hard for me to do so I would appreciate it being correctly reviewed. Please let my advocate team consisting of XXXX XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX know if you need any further information. SPS has this information on file already, but just in case, I am again attaching my written authorization to speak with them regarding this matter. I am XXXX and it is sometimes hard for me to get out to a fax to send documents that they may already have on hand. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

About 2 weeks later I received {$500.00}. I contacted the company and when would I get the remainder and was told "" once I paid the {$500.00}. '' I was told the payments were {$40.00} dollars a month for every {$1000.00} borrowed. I paid the {$500.00} in about a month and then received the additional that I had, initially requested. Everything was fine, I was making my payments on time and, sometimes I would pay more than required. I paid the balance to less than half of the total of {$3000.00}. To this day, I do n't know what happened, I do n't understand why this debt was sold or assigned to a collections company. I was never late, I never missed a payment and was never contacted that there was any issues with my account. I did not even know that the debt had been assigned to a collections company until my credit was pulled by a car dealer. On my report with XXXX it says that I have a collections to XXXX for {$2900.00} and on my XXXX it says I owe XXXX and I only know that it 's Profit Services Group because of the name and address listed for this company. I was never notified by XXXX financial that my account was in collections nor was I ever notified by Profit Services Group that I owed them or anyone for that matter. I do not believe that that is fair to just tarnish someone 's credit without verifying with them about a debt and allowing me the opportunity to remedy the situation before they ruined my credit. I did not receive a phone call nor any piece of mail advising me that I owe Profit Services Group {$2900.00}, of which, the original creditor I had never been late with. My person who wrote the loan up for me, on behalf of XXXX informed me that several others whom he had written loans up for had been complaining about XXXX XXXX and how they had started collections efforts on a client who did not cash their check and sent the check back, as well as, people whom he said had expressed horrors of being over billed. I assure you that I am not making this up. I am not trying to bad mouth the company neither. I would like this negative entry removed off of my credit report immediately and I do n't feel that I should have to spend money to hire an attorney because a collections company is negligent with their reporting. The amount is wrong nor did I ever go into collections. If they would have contacted me before they just blatantly lied to the credit bureaus, which is another issue, How can these people destroy peoples credit. I 'm almost XXXX years old and I work hard to keep my credit record clean. Please, do not think that I 'm angry with you all, I know that you have this forum here to try and help me resolve this.

The mortgage application was begun in XXXX 2015. It is now XXXX 2015, and we still have received the clear-to-close from the bank. 
In XXXX 2015, XXXX XXXX finally informed us that there is a termite inspection requirement. She also made a false statement saying that the inspection can not be paid for by the veteran ( myself ) applying for the loan. This is in direct contradiction to federal law ( See XXXX XXXX XXXX ). After informing her of this law, she continued to insist that the veteran can not pay for it. 
Furthermore, XXXX XXXX waited until XXXX XXXX, 2015, to request the results of the water test, which was performed on XXXX XXXX, 2015, which were also forwarded to her at that time. The test consisted of XXXX XXXX and coliform. XXXX XXXX then requested that nitrites, nitrates, and lead be included in the test, again falsely claiming that this was required by the VA. I spoke with XXXX XXXX at the VA Home Loan Center, who confirmed that this is not a requirement by the VA. After informing XXXX XXXX that I spoke with the VA, she redacted her requirement. 
XXXX XXXX then requested a structural inspection of the property, once again falsely claiming it is a VA requirement. And once again, XXXX XXXX at the VA Home Loan Center confirmed that this was not required by the VA. After again returning to XXXX XXXX , she then changed her story and stated that the structural inspection is a requirement of Citizens Bank . I asked her why she did not inform us of this inspection at the beginning of the process, 3 months ago, and she did not produce a response. 
In the beginning of the mortgage process, Citizens Bank informed me we would close on our property in XXXX. I correspondingly made arrangements for my new employer to begin employment at that time. Since we still have not closed on our house, I have been driving XXXX miles a day between XXXX and XXXX County, paying tolls each way. We sold our apartment in XXXX, but since we could not move into our new house, the buyers of our apartment allowed us to continue dwelling there. They finally could not tolerate the delay any longer, and I am now living under my desk in my office, and my wife is living on a couch in XXXX. All of our belongings are in a temporary storage unit.

The Navient representative indicated that I could not consolidate my loans XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX because they were returned to the guarantor ( The Federal Government ) and that I should contact them. The call was disconnected ( I 'm is not sure if the representative disconnected or not ). I called back and spoke with another representative, who told me that the loans XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX could not be consolidated because Navient had submitted them to The Federal Government, and the Federal Government had "" rejected '' them and returned them to Navient, therefore, Navient "" owned them '' and that I would have to pay them in full to Navient. I asked why the Federal Government had rejected them and when did this happen. The Navient representative said he did not have that information. I then contacted the Federal Government student loans office, and I spoke with the National Student Loans Systems representative. She checked their database and told me that Navient had NOT submitted the loans to them, and the Federal Government had not rejected any request from Navient. She indicated that she could see and could determine from the database ( Federal Government ) any transactions that would have affected my loans. She transferred me to a representative who helped me complete the online loan consolidation request ( at the Federal Student Loan website ). My loans XXXX through XXXX were included in the consolidation request. PLEASE help, I hope to consolidate my loans and request an Income Driven Repayment plan.

On XXXX we received a letter from Flagstar closing our file due to untimely response to their requests for information.Below is a record of all of the e-mail correspondence and activity showing little to no gap between requests for information and responses providing that information. 
XXXX - Uploaded my and my wife 's determination letters from unemployment letter as well as copies of my wife 's and my licenses, front and back. 
XXXX XXXX - received an e-mail asking us to complete a form XXXX however the attachment that was sent to us was a different form. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - responded to the rep asking about the form where he was asking us to complete fields that were not reflected in the form he sent. 
XXXX XXXX PM - Received the correct XXXX form from the rep. 
XXXX uploaded the form to Flagstar 's website. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - e-mailed the rep as we had received a letter in the mail asking us to arrange a call with him and requested options in his availability to have the call. 
XXXX XXXX - Received an e-mail from the rep asking to disregard the letter as we had already covered everything by e-mail. 
XXXX XXXX - Rep e-mailed to request another copy of the XXXX as they are unable to retrieve the form from the uploaded forms at their web site. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - e-mailed a copy of the completed XXXX to the rep. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - received an e-mail from the rep asking us to complete a form titled Page XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX - e-mailed the completed form titled Page XXXX to the rep and notified him that there was no place for me to upload the form to their web site. In this e-mail I also asked for his guidance, where I had called in that week to talk with him and the call center was not allowed to transfer me to him, I wanted to be sure where the process was because we had been able to cover the last few months payments while going through this process and we 're coming up on another payment that is going to be difficult to cover ; wanted to be sure the bank had on record that we are diligently going through the process to remain in good standing but soon will be unable to cover the payments. 
XXXX XXXX - e-mailed rep as we had received a letter from flagstar dated XXXX stating that they were closing our file because I was missing critical information to complete the evaluation and they had received no response from me in a significant period of time. Notified him that I had a copy of all correspondence and reminded him he had not even responded to questions I had asked. 
XXXX XXXX- called Flagstar and spoke with a rep who advised me that there is nothing anyone can do once they close the file and that she could not transfer me to the rep or his department. Asked to speak with a supervisor and was told that there is nothing they could do. The call center rep suggested that I either start the process over or e-mail all of the completed documents to the rep I had been working with in the hopes he would reopen the file. I explained that the rep does not respond and therefore I would have no idea if he just deleted the e-mail and asked for the e-mail address of someone senior and reliable that I could cc on the e-mail to ensure it was seen and acted on. They were unable to share any managers ' information with me. 
XXXX XXXX - e-mailed the rep as suggested with all of the documentation ( even the ones that had been uploaded back in XXXX XXXX recounting the discussion with the call center rep and asking that he respond as to how we move forward. 
XXXX XXXX - received a read receipt from the e-mail I sent. 
It is now XXXX and I have had no response, no guidance, no assistance. A cust who has always paid on time ; now late fees or worse?

03/31/2016,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"In XXXX, 2016 I used my credit card with account number ending in XXXX to reserve a room at XXXX - XXXX for 7 days from XXXX through XXXX with the amount of {$450.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 around XXXX When I arrived in the hotel, I immediately felt the need to change to another hotel due to unacceptable room conditions - TV not working, no hot water and filthy room environment. Around XXXX that evening, I informed the receptionist of my decision to end my stay early due to the unpleasant room situation. The room condition was so abhorrent to an extent that the receptionist had to apologize to me, reduce the rate and honor my decision. I then paid {$100.00} cash in full for XXXX nights and proceeded to book other hotels. 

I want to emphasize the fact that prior to my actions, I called BOA Credit Card Customer Service and spoke with the representative who verified that the amount of {$450.00} did not appear on my credit card statement. BOA representative further reassured me that this amount will NOT appear on the statement without XXXX swiping my card. With BOA 's reassurance, I felt comfortable and protected to end my reservation with XXXX early and book other hotels. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I found out that the charge of {$450.00} appeared on my credit card statement. I immediately called Bank of America ( BOA ), my banking and financing carrier, to file a dispute. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, BOA received my inquiry and started researching my dispute. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received letters from BOA in inquiry of me providing more information on my end to help continue their investigation. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I called XXXX regarding the charge in dispute. The receptionist apologized to me again on behalf of their negligence and admitting to the fraudulent charge. The receptionist provided me with the payment documentation showing that I only stayed there for XXXX nights and paid the the fee cash in full. The receptionist also welcomes BOA to call her directly for verification during the investigation process. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I provided BOA with my response that included my statement, payment documentation, my effort to resolve the dispute and testimony from the receptionist at XXXX. 

ON XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received a denial letter from BOA denying my claim due to "" We ( BOA ) did n't receive valid documentation to show that the charge ( s ) was paid by another means. '' On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I called BOA to express my extreme dissatisfaction of their Credit Claims Department denying my legitimate claim. After carefully reviewing this claim as well as all the documentations I provided, BOA representative acknowledged it 's a valid claim. Per my request, BOA reactivated this claim. 

This continuing ordeal with BOA makes me highly doubt BOA 's ability to protect their customers. Even with valid payment documentations AND the merchant 's testimony admitting to the fraudulent charge, BOA still denied my claim. I highly doubt that BOA even exercised their due diligence and professional conduct to investigate this claim before they simply mailed me with the denied letter.

10/22/2015,Payday loan,Payday loan,Charged bank acct wrong day or amt,Charged bank acct wrong day or amt,"I initially set up a "" payday '' loan and the company converted it to a "" flex line of credit '' loan. I used XXXX bank account to create the loan and have the funds deposited. I made some payments out of this account. I then wanted to change the financial institution and account that the payments came out of. I was unable to remove the initial account but I was able to add a new account. My payments have been coming out of the new account without any issues. I changed jobs and needed to change my due date to line up with my new paydays. I emailed the company to ask how to do that. They said to send in new paystubs to verify my new pay dates. I did that only to have them come back with a "" form letter '' email telling me that I could not change my due dates even though this loan was set up with payments to be when I got paid. The VERY NEXT payment after I requested a due date change did n't deduct from my account like it always did. The next day after the due date I got a notice from my initial back that I set the loan up with stating that I had a payment that attempted to clear but there were no funds to clear the payment. I was charged a {$29.00} NSF Fee and my account was now in the negative. I looked to see what happened and this lender, who has been charging the "" new '' account for MONTHS without incident, attempted to take my payment out of the "" old '' account that I was no longer using. I called them immediately and advised them that they had no authorization to change my preferred payment account and that the only reason the old account was on there as because I could n't remove it. I asked why they had been taking all my payments with no issue from the new account then suddenly attempted to withdrawal from an account that was not being used. I advised them that they created an NSF Fee and that I needed this issue resolved ASAP and the NSF Fee covered by them. I was placed on hold to have them come back and say that they "" had a system update '' on their end and it defaulted back to my original account. I advised them that I was given no notice from them that they were having system upgrades and that I needed to verify my preferred account was correct. I advised them that I was not responsible for that account even being on there since I had no ability to remove the account. I was told that they would NOT be crediting me back the NSF Fee because I had that account on there system. I advised them that I had proof that they had been taking the funds from another account and that there were no issues, I also could not remove the old account and that I was never notified that I needed to verify my account because of their system upgrade. I advised them that this was a violation of my consumer rights. I do not even want to have auto payments with them but they advise me that I can not pay via any other method, I am FORCED to use auto pay and they can take the money from any account they have on file. I advised them that I would be reporting this issue. I asked for written documentation of this incident and their stance. I was advised they can not provide any written information about any of this because of privacy laws. I said that was not correct. I was placed on hold again and then advised that if I did n't report this issue they would credit me back the {$29.00} but I needed to send proof of the NSF Fee and that they were the cause of it. I obtained the NSF notice from the bank, the account ledger showing the fee and proof it was their company. I emailed it at instructed to have them reply stating that I had to have a FULL COPY of a 30 day bank statement with ALL pages attached and my account number, name, bank info, etc. All the info I provided them already but now they want to see a full copy of my 30 day statement ( that 's my personal info that does n't apply to them ) and I will have to wait 30+ days to get it.

I had no idea what is recast until he mention it. Had he said it 's not free, would n't I chosen pay higher down payment? 
I feel being deceived. Both mortgage companies are benefit of charging me more.

08/20/2016,Credit card,,Arbitration,,"Dear sir or madam, On XXXX XXXX I was advised that XXXX of my CITI credit cards were closed. No representative from CITI bank was able to explain why. Only XXXX ( out of XXXX ) supervisor vaguely suggested that this could be due to an ongoing dispute and fraud department closed my account after an ongoing investigation. I sent this letter to CITI but no answer Dear Sir or Madam, I was informed that my accounts were closed after fraud investigation. No representative was able to tell me why, only few vague suggestions. It shocked and frustrated me the way your fraud department handled this issue and just closed both of my accounts without explanations or without even contacting me for supporting documents regarding disputes that were previously resolved in my favor ( see letter attached ) I contacted fraud department and they advised me to contact the office of the President because they could n't resolve this issue and they were n't even sure why my accounts were closed. I was with you for almost 4 years now, never missed any payments, made Citi cards my primary cards for all payments including for those abroad. I established good credit and was continuously on the way to increase my credit score, until you just shut down both accounts with balances on them, ruining my credit! 

After reviewing all my charges I do n't see any fraudulent transactions nor I was informed about attempted fraudulent charges. Representative and then supervisor from Fraud Department told me that they never saw anything like this and could n't tell me why both accounts were closed. Recently I was traveling a lot to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, plus I made some hotel reservations in XXXX and XXXX, but these are all my transactions and I am responsible for them, no fraud was ever reported. 

I had few disputes recently due to a fact that my friends were unable to get US visa and therefore unable to travel on XXXX flights that were purchased using Citi dividend card. I disputed those charges and indicated the fact that visa was denied and people are n't able to even enter the country and unable to board the plane, which is proven with the letter from American embassy in XXXX ( see attached ) this was a reason for my dispute, it 's supported with the document and properly indicated, These disputes were resolved in my favor ( please see letter attached ). I disputed these transactions because XXXX XXXX were unwilling to help. XXXX returned money upon request immediately in this situation ( see letter attached ) I did everything correctly and legally, indicated true reason for a Dispute and now supporting it with the document. I sincerely ca n't believe that Citi can close the account based on dispute between client and the merchant. If there was no legal basis for me to win that dispute then I would have to be informed about it in writing or asked for additional documents, so that you could adjudicate properly, but non of it was done. There was no dialogue between Citi and me. You just shut down my cards disrespectfully and carelessly damaging by credit for no wrong doing from my part. Problems happen, disputes happen. Sometimes merchants are correct, sometimes clients are correct, but I 've never seen a situation when the bank can give up on the client without any explanations because of the dispute between merchant and and client! Again, if you needed additional info then it could be requested, but why close account and damage credit for someone who was with you for 4 years? 
I suspect that my accounts were closed due to an error. This could potentially cause damage and long term consequences to my credit report by closing cards with outstanding balances on them without informing me. I was a loyal customer for almost 4 years now and sincerely I did n't except that Citi would EVER handle issues this way",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2073522

My daughter ended up on academic probation for XXXX semesters, during which we paid interest on the loan. ( I believe this must 've triggered some automated 'loan is in repayment ' mode. ) When she was reinstated, all loans went back into deferment. Allied Interstate called me about this loan once approx. 2 years ago, and I explained the probation/deferment situation. I understood this to be the end of the problem. I heard no more until XXXX of this year, when I got a notice from my employer about garnishment! It 'd been sent to default erroneously, a month before my daughter even graduated! I contacted Allied, & was given different numbers, amounts, and instructions each time- but no one could tell me any of the specifics of the original loan so that I could provide proof of deferment. I finally got it escalated to a manager who was able to tell me the amount of the original loan. Through a great deal of research, my kid was able to find the detailed evidence we needed on her student portal. I faxed this proof in as instructed, 2 1/2 months ago. Despite my sending proof and several follow-up requests, I 've yet to hear back or see my paycheck restored. When I call, they tell me to call the Dept. of Ed. ( When I call DoE, they say talk to Allied! ) Meanwhile, I 'm left without the funds to cover my XXXX, as they are taking out {$600.00} every month.

11/03/2016,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"About 13 months ago I filed a complaint with your organization related to Ditech Mortgage ( XXXX ). They promised to pay the homeowner association dues, it is on recorded messages, and they refused to turn over the takes. I was surprised that CFPD did not force them to turn over the takes because they lied. Because they did not pay the association dues I received a noticed from the sheriff office to leave the property ... forced to leave the property. I have repeatedly requested the recording to show that I was promised on several occasions by Ditech associate not to worry and they would take care of it. Today I am receiving letters from Ditech stating that the mortgage has not been paid in 18 months. I communicated to Ditech that the owner association has leased out the property, and they are not paying the mortgage. At this time Ditech has not resolved this issue, and the homeowner association is collecting money and not paying the mortgage. At this time I can not purchase a home because Ditech refuses to foreclose on the property and force the homeowner association to pay the back payments totaling approximately {$34000.00}. I believed that your organization was here to protect people like myself who does not have the resources to fight a big company like Ditech. Please help us now with this issue. Otherwise, Ditech will continue with this practice thus allowing the homeowner association to collect rent and not paying the mortgage. Please HELP!

As a last resort, we contacted the hospital twice, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX using the "" Contact us '' feature on their website, detailing our aggravating story and have been harassed relentlessly by debt collection agencies, and requesting that the balance on my account be corrected and reflect the accurate amount which is XXXX. Both messages were computer-acknowledged but no response whatsoever was forthcoming. 

This very stressful and protracted situation has been going on for more than three years with neither the hospital nor the various debt collectors taking any responsibility to respond and to fully correct the record. 

We would be most grateful for your assistance in correcting this matter.

07/15/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I contacted mortgage broker XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX in XXXX of 2015 to get a mortgage pre-qualification to begin shopping for houses. When we found a house that we loved and made an offer in early XXXX we requested a closing date of XXXX XXXX in the offer based on what XXXX indicated would be a reasonable amount of time to secure the mortgage. On XXXX XXXX I went to XXXX 's office to sign all of the application paperwork and asked again if we would be on track for a XXXX XXXX closing and was told that we should be OK. I was asked for various documents along the way and always responded quickly, normally the same day. I followed up a few times about the date since I was planning to secure friends to assist with the move and we were selling the existing house that we were living in the following week. On XXXX XXXX I received a conditional commitment and was told that we still looked good for a XXXX XXXX closing but they just need to tie up a couple things. The issue came on XXXX XXXX, I sent an email asking for a status at XXXX XXXX and received the following response at XXXX : "" We got all of the conditions related to you cleared ; however there is a condition related to the appraisal which should have been cleared by the appraiser earlier this week ( basically, an "" explain why you did XXXX on comp # XXXX '' type question ), which the appraiser did not take care of before leaving on vacation for this week. We are requesting "" backup '' to see if the appraisal management firm can fill in for him on it, but since it 's an explanation of a judgement call I ca n't say for certain whether than can be cleared before next Monday. So that makes it likely that your closing gets pushed to the middle or end of next week. "" Basically I was told about one full business day prior to the date I was supposed to close that it could not happen. I had time scheduled off work, a rental truck reserved, friends planning to assist, had to make the sellers of our other house adjust their timing. The feeling I got was that these things happen in this industry and everyone pointed fingers at it being someone else 's fault, the underwriter needs something, but the appraiser is on vacation, the broker can do anything with United Wholesale Mortgage, and XXXX would not give any information to applicants, etc. I understand that things happen, but to be given such little notice was extremely stressful and resulted in additional costs of having to pay movers and adjust my schedule - let alone settle in to my new home.

I have called every 10-14 days since to have this corrected. Each time I am told a department did n't do their particular job and they will forward an email to have the correction made. I was told on half a dozen occasions that a new escrow report would be done and they would correct the account. No report has been run and no changes have been made. I called again today and was told again, went to wrong department and check back in 3 days.

I advised them that we are 100 % covered by insurance and we submitted our insurance information to the hospital upon check in on XXXX/XXXX/14 and that all the other bills were paid. They said now it is too late and refused to help us. It has almost been a year since I was in the hospital and this charge is barely posting to the credit report?! This office obviously has billing problems. We were never notified of any issues with the billing and did n't expect to be since our insurance covers 100 %.

I feel that if I had a question regarding my creditworthiness I would n't have unfroze my credit and applied for the card. 
Nordstrom 's Credit Card Interest rates and Interest charges section states "" Your APR will be assigned when you open your account, based on your creditworthiness. After that, your APR will vary with the market based on the prime rate '' My average credit score between the XXXX bureaus XXXX and XXXX is XXXX, which are the XXXX bureaus Nordstrom credit uses. I tried to find out what was the reason behind my XXXX he was n't able to really explain other then he said my score was a XXXX and it qualified for the XXXX, the represenative said he would be able to give me XXXX rate and do to me still not being satisfied with his response he then said he would not switch to the XXXX do to me still not being satisfied with there response. I believe I have been taken advantage of and now if i close the credit card it will reflect on my credit negative.

On XX/XX/XXXX I paid the mortgage off after ensuring that the XX/XX/XXXX payment had also been made. The web site showed that the next payment was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. In spite of this and that I had paid the entire mortgage they took another payment on XX/XX/XXXX. By this time they had removed my account from the web site with any information about the mortgage so I called the XXXX number for Capital One. After explaining the problem I was told that they would transfer the money back to my checking account in 3 to 7 days even though I told them that they had taken the money from my account and I needed the money to pay bills now. 
Seven days later ( XXXX XXXX or so ) I called again since they had not returned the money yet. I was told by XXXX that I had to wait 10 to 15 days and they would then send the information to another group who would write a physical check and then mail it out to me. I told them that this was not acceptable. She told me she would check on what they could do and get back to me within two hours. She never called back. 
I was away the week of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and found a few messages on my answering machine when I returned. XXXX from the President 's line at Capital one 360 told me that since I did not answer all of her calls she would not call back again but she left a number ( XXXX extension XXXX ) where I could call her. I called on XXXX XXXX but have not received a call back yet. 
Also on my return last week I found an overnight envelope propped against the door. It contained a check From Capital One made out for the wrong amount from a nonexistent account. 
I would like to have them return the money quickly. If necessary by deposit in my checking account with them and to ensure that they do not take another payment in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I submitted a claim to the wrong department in New York State and they said that they have referred the claim to this agency but I need to make sure because the money that Capital One took from my account is needed to pay tax bills this month.",,Capital One,NY,120XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/12/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2107649

When I did not receive any of the requested information, I contacted the school to find out the name of the collection agency my account was referred to. I was provided a different name other than Enterprise Recovery Systems. I then started making payments to the school directly thinking the company was not legitimate. Enterprise Recovery later placed the collection account on my credit report ; I disputed it because I was never properly informed of the debt. After the dispute was filed, I received notification of the outstanding balance via mail ( today. ) I contacted Enterprise and the representative advised there were numerous calls but my identity was never confirmed. I explained that was correct because I would not give them my ssn via telephone. I advised her that I will be paying the balance in full and requested the collection be removed from my credit report due to lack of and improper communication. She advised they wo n't remove it they will only place paid in full on my report which I think is unfair.

04/03/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have a variety of disputes with the manner that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and XXXX have handled the origination and servicing of my mortgage loan. 

However, I recently spoke with XXXX representatives at Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to request an opportunity to apply for a HAMP loan or other loan modification options. 

I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo would send me Form XXXX and a loan modification package to start the review process. After three weeks, I still have not received any documentation from Wells Fargo. 

The company has notoriously sent information after previously scheduled foreclosures dates to prevent me from having a chance to respond within a reasonable time frame. 

A current foreclosure date is scheduled and the company will probably send the modification documents on the day before the sale date. It 's this type action that prevents me from reaching an amicable resolution with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. 

I requested a loan modification last summer ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and Wells Fargo said that I could not obtain a modification to stop the foreclosure that was 14 days away. The foreclosure specialists within the Home Preservation department said that I should have contacted the company prior to 30 days -- to stop the sale and to apply for a loan modification. The foreclosure was cancelled at the last minute, but Wells Fargo never sent any of the documents that were promised to begin the modification review. 

Since my last request, nothing has been done by Wells Fargo. 

What 's frustrating to me is that, I contacted Wells Fargo three weeks ago and indicated to several representatives that I wanted to save my home and that I did not want to hear that a month was needed to apply for a modification and to cancel the foreclosure sale, as any viable solutions were being considered. 

At this point the I have not received any information from Wells Fargo and the sale has not been canceled. This is another tactic that the company uses to prevent homeowners from applying for government-sponsored loan programs. 

Additionally, I have suffered from predatory lending abuses, as well as investor and servicer fraud. Some of the abuses that the CFPB will challenge later this year might not be available to me, and other homeowners in similar situations. 

My loan was originated with appraisal fraud, as the closing documents clearly show that underwriter-requested conditions required closer sales comps. My home was brand new with plenty of sales within close proximity to my home, but the XXXX and XXXX sales comps were both XXXX miles away. 

Since my loan was sold, Wells Fargo has fraudulently created and recorded XXXX ( XXXX ) bogus mortgage assignments in an effort to correct the original documentation with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Each attempt to fix the botched mortgage assignment was worse than the previous, however there has been criminal attempts to affirm their standing without any effort to resolve our differences. 

I am seeking speedy resolutions to remedy this situation, and ask the CFPB to require Wells Fargo to cancel the currently scheduled foreclosure sale, as I did contact the company in a timely manner or to cancel the sale while I pursue other legal options to sue Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

07/28/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"At the very last minute, after business hours on the last day it would be possible for me to obtain a mortgage and close on the purchase of a home on time, and several weeks after the Bank of America had all the information they initially said they needed to assess my loan qualifications ( about XXXX pages of tax returns and other income information they required ), and also at least a week after the day they said they would commit to the loan, the bank pulled a "" bait and switch. '' They told me I could get the loan only if I agreed to a higher interest rate than the agreed-upon rate. This rate they insisted on was 1.25 percentage points higher ( 4.75 % ) than their advertised rate of 3.5 % on that date even though I was putting down, and I put 25 percent of the purchase down. Since I would lose my {$5000.00} deposit AND the house I contracted to purchase if I did n't close on time, the bank knew I had no choice but to agree to the higher interest rate. 

I believe this may be a common practice of the Bank of America, one used to force mortgagors to accept substantially higher interest rates than those they advertise and contractually agree to. It is certainly a clever way to get around their obligation to meet their commitments and to force innocent loan-seekers into paying above-market interest rates. 

They also tried to force me -- though they eventually relented on this -- to garnish my bank checking account for a year-and-a-half 's worth of advance payments on property tax and homeowner 's insurance even though I had a long track record of paying my own taxes and insurance on other properties I own. This of course would take from me the use of my money over a substantial period of time and transfer the use of that money to the Bank of America.

It is no wonder they have grown so large with the continual praying on middle class, and lower income folks like myself with outrageous, and unjustifiable fees. The worst thing I know of all is regularly manipulating the on line banking entries of debits, and credits. Debits will be held, purposely not showing them, not even showing them in the pending status for days, as they watch your balance dropping down, the bank knowing, and hoping you overdraft just before a payday. Then, at the over draft point, they will re-arrange the order of the entries to appear that you not only over drafted a few dollars on the '' real '' last charge '' debit ' you made. The new entry arrangement on this newest date of over draft now will show ( in the banks favor of course ) that you over drafted with one of the larger debit entries several days earlier. And now the day before your pay day auto deposit, they hit you with many tiny debit entries ( a few dollars each ) each with o.d. fee each of {$36.00} totaling {$100.00}, {$200.00}, or more. Now the facts after many years watching this closely are this : You have to watch the bank record on- line closely every single day to catch this. They make mistakes - dailey in the nightly work they do balncing your account. The adding subtracting errors they make can throw you own calculations you are trying to keep up with off, and in error. They continually fix errors they show on previous days balancing on next day or so - further throwing you off in error.

I was unable to make the new payment so I have been sending as much as I can per month. Apparently that makes no difference. When I told XXXX XXXX that I had not paid because I did n't have enough money in my bank account, she was incredibly rude and short with me. When I said I only had {$400.00} in my account she asked me why I could n't afford to pay at least {$300.00}. Then she asked if I was employed. When I said yes she asked me if I had a job they why could n't I make the payment. She asked me what had changed that made me unable to make payments. My payments doubled, that is what happened. She was incredibly rude and treated me like a criminal when I am in fact sending payments, just not the full amount. She made me feel awful and embarrassed. And this all happened at work, so everyone could overhear me defending myself, then arguing with the woman and finally crying.

I ended up speaking to XXXX XXXX XXXX the General Sales Manager which he showed me an print out the payoff from XXXX XXXX of what I owed was {$21000.00} but they only offered me {$14000.00} for the trade in. My truck was an XX/XX/XXXX Mitsubishi Outlander Sport with XXXX, XXXX miles on it. I advised I did not want to go up in payments that I needed to stay at {$400.00} a month. When talking to XXXX XXXX XXXX he advised me with {$1000.00} dollars down at a interest rate at XXXX that I would be paying XXXX a month or {$4000.00} down I would be paying {$520.00} a month. I had asked XXXX if I could come back on Saturday to purchase the car to let me think about it. XXXX told me to meet with the Finance Manager that he may have some other rates and specials to get my car note down. I asked XXXX about the car insurance if it will increase or decrease since I am paying {$120.00} a month for car insurance. Than XXXX told XXXX XXXX the Client Advisor to shut up when he was talking to me and XXXX was asking a question I had. XXXX did not like it since he was talking. So XXXX told me that my car insurance will decrease since the car I was purchasing is an BMW and the insurance is cheaper since it is an foreign car. XXXX told me that he could not guarantee that the car would be available to purchase. I advised XXXX that was fine because there are other cars that I can look at. I was getting ready to leave and XXXX stopped me to ask me if I had time to fill out the application. So I rushed to fill out the application because I was pressed for time because they were making me late for work. I filled out the application and then XXXX had asked me for my credit card to hold the vehicle when I did not even say I was purchasing the vehicle. XXXX took down my XXXX XXXX Credit Card information and told me if I do not come back on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that he will run my credit card. I advised XXXX that he can not run my credit card when I have not even signed the contract and that I did not authorize him to process my credit card. I advised that I would come back on XXXX XXXX, cause I did not want him to run my credit card. 
I had came back to the dealership on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and met with XXXX XXXX the Client Advisor to fill out the other paperwork he had for me. Then he ended passing me off to XXXX XXXX the XXXX Manager. Josh went over the the paperwork before I signed my name, showing me with an XXXX interest rate with {$4000.00} down that I would be paying {$510.00} a month with an credit score at XXXX. But he advised me that my credit score was an XXXX that I would be paying {$530.00} a month at interest rate at XXXX. XXXX stated with the XXXX interest rate that I did not have to worry about replacing tires, stereo system, brakes, oil changes or anything else that goes wrong with the car. Stated if I would of done the XXXX interest rate that I would have to pay for repairs even though the car had an XXXX year warranty on the car. I had asked XXXX if I could cancel the contract while signing and he told me no that I could not cancel the contract. So I ended of leaving with the new vehicle. 
When I arrived at the dealership.. XXXX of the salesman told me that XXXX was somewhere and that XXXX was busy with a client and that someone will be with me in a few. So they thought it was okay to pass me off to an Internet Sales Manager to discuss the issue of me wanting to return the vehicle and cancel the contract and get my truck back. As I was explaining to XXXX XXXX the Internet Sales Manager that I wanted to cancel the contract and do an flat cancel/unwind and he told me that there is no such thing as that. He also stated that there is no such law in the XXXX of Texas that you can not do a flat cancel/unwind.

Citi Mortgage has played along like they are trying to help us but never actually do, they kept switching my contract person, I think I had a total of XXXX different people at XXXX time, I sent a Qualified Written request letter request some informaiton on our loan, they sent some info but not the main information that I wanted. 
We have went to court, In court I stated the only way that they are a debt collector and call us and state theya re trying to collect on the loan is if they bought our loan when it was in default. And that is exactly what they did, but when I ask for our assingment records they will not send me the documentation on it. 
everytime I have talked to them they state XXXX XXXX owns our loan. 
I am currently seeking the help of a local lawyer and will appeal our case, there are several things they did wrong. The Judge did not seem impressed with the laws that I had stated that were put in place to protect the home owners and her attitude was, I will let them win and they will still work with you to keep your house. Which I do n't think they will do, so I need to act quickly to the court and make them understand these laws and rules are put in place for a reason and if judges just dismiss them and do not abide by them what good are they? 
Any help you can give us whould be greatly appreciated.

THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE THEY NEVER EVER TOLD ME HOW MUCH THEY SOLD THE TOYOTA TACOMA XXXX FOR? THEY SENT ME A CHECK FOR ALMOST {$8000.00} DOLLARS AFTER THEY SOLD IT. 

I left it alone, on XX/XX/XXXX I found out that my Identity was stolen them I begin to search and request my XXXX Credit Free Annual Reports, this is when I begin to discover many issues in my Credit, from accounts that were not mine, alter Information, account balances that were not the correct one 's etc. 
them I discover that GMFinancial how Cynical they were after they knew I had a Verifiable XXXX Status they Punish me by declaring to the Credit Report Bureaus that my Account that I had with them they declared as a Charge Off/Paid THE CYNICAL WERE ABLE TO REPOSSESS THE VEHICLE, SOLD IT GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH AND RUIN ME WITH THE XXXX CREDIT BUREAUS, IF THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE AND PAY OFF THE BALANCE I LEFT OF {$6000.00} DOLLARS WHY? THEY HAD DECLARED AS A CHARGE OFF WHEN THEY GOT THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET MAY BE EVEN MORE MONEY THAT WERE NOT RETURNED BACK TO ME. IN FACT I HAD MORE POWER OVER THE VEHICLE SINCE I HAD PAY THEM ALREADY {$41000.00}. 

My Problem is since they were not able to help me to remove the CHARGE OFF because they do n't want to, knowing that they sold the Vehicle pay off the balance I left out therefore there were not lost here. I am the one who lost the Vehicle, Lost Money during the sale of the Vehicle that GMFinancial did, without letting me know how much was the bill of sale until today is unknown, on top they put a derogative remark on my credit report with the Charge off. 

THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH YOU, FIRST OFF THEY NEED TO RELEASE THE BILL OF SALE, HOW MUCH THEY SOLD THE TOYOTA TACOMA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE CHARGE OFF REMOVED, IS CREATING PROBLEMS TO MY CREDIT WHEN IN FACT THE ACCOUNT WAS PAIS OFF ALREADY WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TO PUNISHING ME BECAUSE I GOT SICK AND BECAME XXXX, I AM XXXX INDIVIDUAL FOR LIFE, I FEEL PUNISH BY GMFINANCIAL, CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME TO SEE IF YOU FIND ANY ISSUES AS FAR AS ABUSING THE CONSUMER OF VIOLATIONS TO CONSUMER LAW. 
I WANT TO GET A REFUND FOR THE MONEY THAT THEY DID NOT RELEASE TO ME, WHEN THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE, I BELIEVE THAT IS MY RIGHT TO KNOW HOW MUCH WAS THE EXACT AMOUNT THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE FOR, SINCE THEY PAID OFF THE {$6000.00} OF THE SALE OF THE VEHICLE IS FAIR FOR THEM TO REMOVED THE NEGATIVE REMARK IN MY CREDIT REPORT, THE 3 MONTH LATE WAS NOT INTENTIONAL.

When I finally spoke with a NationStar representative I found out I was transferred to NationStar XX/XX/XXXX! They received payment for a couplemonths then it stopped. Apparently XXXX XXXX never gave them the correct contact info for me either ... so they were never able to get in touch with me to tell me about the transfer of my loan or how they were not receiving the payments I was sending.

The account was then later sold to a Florida entity named XXXX XXXX. Around from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX I was on a duty XXXX. Upon my return a year later with no prior correspondence the collection company served my roommate. I showed up to court and made payment arrangements that were inflated with interests. While I was making payment, I called in and inquired about making a payment that consisted of a large sum to be distributed evenly across a number of months. The representative on the phone accepted the payment and they defaulted me the following month for non-payment. I was a student and not working, they placed a lien on my bank account. I had a lawyer submit a file to remove the lien and told them he would be representing me from that point forward. Since then, the attorney has n't received neither calls nor correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, neither have I. On Monday XXXX XXXX, at about XXXX XXXX a sheriff showed up to my apartment with a court execution order to levy my property. He parked behind my car and forbade me to leave the premises without handing over my car keys unless I wrote him a check for {$4600.00}. I pleaded with them that this car is how I earn my income as a ride share driver, he called a town truck and impounded the car with a notice to resolve the matter in 45 days or the car would be sold. Since then I have filed a Notice to Defendant of Right Against Garnishment, Wages, Money, and Other Property. I contacted the collection agency and the person handling the case advised me to have my lawyer contact them. He has tried for the past three weeks and has n't successfully spoken to anyone except for a secretary who told him someone will return his call. It appears I have n't been giving any choice in this matter. I was under the impression they 'd want their money but instead they rather have me suffer and not earning an income. I do n't understand how this is justifiable. I 'm going 21 days without my car. It 's costing me {$32.00} per day on average to travel to a per Diem job where I 'm only earning {$85.00} before tax. My hands are tied at this point, I just want to resolve this issue. Thank you.

I became XXXX and called to make a claim. I was asked by the operator at XXXX XXXX the date the accident happened. They came back and told me I no longer had XXXX insurance as of the accident date and I was "" AGED DOWN TO DEATH BENEFIT ONLY '' on that exact date. I argued and got nowhere. 
I have always had perfect XXXXplus credit scores. I continued to pay and continued to argue going all the way up the ladder to the Office of the CEO whose secretary of XXXX told me that XXXX XXXX is not XXXX. I called back Credit shield where I was told '' dont let them tell you we are not XXXX..we ARE XXXX ''. I called back and this same secretary told me my account was sold to a collection agency. I heard nothing more. The next thing I heard was my bank account was frozen. There are liens on my home/finances and that FORSTER and GARBUS are the collectors and own the judgments levied against me via default. I NEVER knew about the actions. The then AG of NY XXXX XXXX made an across state VACATE o all FORSTER GARBUS fraudulent default judgements, over XXXX XXXX in NYS alone were vacated. My attorney I had hired prior to this AG action or release even being mentioned had no knowledge of XXXX 's actions, and then sent another lawyer in the firm to represent the case since mine was called to do a TV show that same time and the lawyer filling in on the case represented me as a simple single judgement being placed on me from XXXX and not FORSTER GARBUS class action. Now Forster Garbus could stand there with a proper legal judgement handed down by a judge for me defaulting yet they used the court system laws to illegally obtain the decision since I along with ( NATIONWIDE and later found INTERNATIONAL victims of this crime ) was never notified. I was supposed to be one of the victims helped by AG XXXX 's office and have this vacated. I have tried twice now to get an attorney to assist me in this but as it turns out they perceive it as my attempting to have XXXX lawyer discredit another. I just want this ILLEGAL judgment vacated. Forster Garbus was found to be the number one perpetrators in this crime were found guilty and later so was XXXX for these and other illegal credit card practices and all victims had these judgments vacated. 
Forster Garbus has just contacted me again in an attempt to collect this illegal judgement making me still a victim and they still guilty of this illegal judgment on behalf of guilty XXXX as reported again XX/XX/2015 for over XXXX XXXX XXXX was ordered to refund card holders. I have NO one who will assist me here on this. I need someone to act on MY behalf and retro add me to the AG class action. These criminals have been acknowledged by NYS JUSTICE and ALL their judgments VACATED. Will you help me? If you check my credit history you will see I am never late and always take care of personal business. IF I had received ANY notice of court action I would have been in court presenting every statement showing the Credit shield payments nor would I EVER have allowed myself to be "" AGED DOWN '' and on the exact date of the accident either. Its a lie and also unconstitutional to discriminate for age. I am a victim of a well documented crime that has used the court system to do it. Not only for me but a change must be made in legally being served in that a person being served for a possible default must have the defendants signature on the notice to prove being served so this cant happen again. I would have been in court with ALL MY PROOF had I been served and that is why XXXX were not notified. Again, I hope you will help seeing as FORSTER GARBUS are at it again and again I am a victim of the legal system they illegally used

After dealing with this company, I feel it is very important that all pertinent agencies are notified about their shady business practices. Every other hard money lender in AZ said what he was doing was 100 % illegal for an owner occupied home. I am hoping my letter writing will get someone to look into this company and their ability to follow and understand the law, before they really hurt someone. With all the information they have on me I am terrified of what they are capable of doing to me. I am hoping to put a fraud alert on with all the credit agencies for everyone involved in the deal. 
I was very unhappy with this company! I worked with XXXX XXXX. This particular man did not show me respect. He told blatant lies. Another party and I were in the process of purchasing a home with XXXX. He took all our personal financial info ( including bank account info and social security numbers ) and sent us a pre-qualification letter. We found a home and put in an offer, following his guidelines. We thought all was good. We were wrong. The man disappeared. The buyers ( me ), the sellers, our agent, their agent, the title company and the inspection company were all on hold. We talked to the receptionist and she did not know what was going and would under no circumstances allow us to speak to another lender. Then all the phone message machines ( voice mails ) were full, XXXX 's and the front main line. This went on for days until we lost the house. I asked XXXX to simply pay us back for the wire transfer costs to the title company of {$35.00}. He refused and still refuses to this day. I am XXXX and he knew it from all the paperwork. He took advantage and lied to a XXXX person. His lack of communication with his clients was below sub-par at best. 
I honestly believe this man thinks he is above the law and better than other people. Pure sociopath in my humble opinion.

I have contacted Navient directly and was told that my individual problem would be resolved, but the larger practice needs to be stopped. I have been making the same automatic debit payment for several years on my student loans. This month, my statement said the amount due was {$300.00} less than it normally is. I was given no notice of this change, and I did not request this change. If I had not been paying attention, I would have started making smaller payments, therefore owing Navient much more over time. When I contacted them, they said "" the system '' automatically recalculated my debit payments. Now that I am getting close to paying off my loans, the system calculates payments to keep me paying longer and therefore owing more interest on more payments? With no notice? This is an extremely deceitful practice. My personal situation should be remedied for the next month ( but only after having a month where I could n't change it, even if I can make my own additional payments ). Consumers need to know that this is happening and to pay attention to their statements. I also do not understand how this can be done without my consent and without notice that it was happening. It feels like a trick to get borrowers to owe more by quietly changing automatic payments that borrowers are n't thinking about because they are automatic.

The lender told them they had to move out since they do n't own the property any more. Therefore the homeowners moved out. The lender proceeded to not foreclose on the property, and instead it has been sitting as a zombie foreclosure for the last year. In addition, the HOA has continued to accrue for the last year, unbeknownst to the consumer. 

The lender then sent a letter to the consumer requesting they market the property and move forward with a short sale. Therefore, the consumer proceeded to hire a real estate agent, market the property, and procure a buyer. 

Now, however, the lender is now refusing to do a workout of any kind, even though they know the mortgage is upside down. They have further endangered the consumer who is no longer allowed to live in the property by accruing debt ( in the consumer 's name ) with the HOA Company. 


The lender has shown cruel treatment to the consumer in every action they have taken : 1. ShellPoint forced the homeowner out of their home 2. ShellPoint forced debt onto the consumer for a property they were prohibited from enjoying 3.

Freedom mortgage has been reported the credit bureaus XXXX, XXXX and XXXX a late payment since XXXX 2015 which has been brought my credit score gradually very low to the point that I was denied a credit transaction. 
I have been greatly affected by this report and have been requesting them several times to fix it to no avail. I am still showing late and my credit score is dropping dramatically. It got to the point that one representative told me to not worry about it that they have all my payments done on time and that was a system mistake. All the times I spoke to Freedom mortgage officers the call was announced to be recorded so I am assuming there are plenty of recording to follow out conversations about my payments that prove I have been asking them many times to fix the issue. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I applied for a refinance loan and was declined. The mortgage office told me I had been late in a mortgage payment since XX/XX/XXXX with Freedom mortgage and with that I was automatically disqualified for a mortgage refinance. 
I immediately call Freedom mortgage but they seem to not understand what is going on and just keep on saying it is going to be fine but the damage is done and they are not fixing it. Nobody has reached me with solutions either. 
I sent the paper work to the credit bureaus but I have not been contacted nor I see any change in my score. My problem needs to be solve with urgency as I am desperately need to refinance a mortgage with very high rate. I am experiencing financial loss due to the false report.

3. XX/XX/2015 : Called, explained the entire situation AGAIN and this time was told could not reversed because it would put my acct into late status ( regardless of 13 day grace period ). Asked for supervisor and rep was on hold too too long attempting to get a supvsr, ( acc to bank policy ) and she would have to end the call. I was not allowed to hold any longer. 

4. Called again and THIS time I was told the cancellation had to have been two business days prior to scheduled autopay for it to be effective Spoke to supervisor who told me nothing could be done. Asked for HER supvsr and was told there was no one else who could help me. 

I was ( am ) having financial difficulties as it is, and NOW my checking acct with a different bank is overdrawn and will have to pay approximately XXXX in overdraft fees! 

AND prior to this, on XX/XX/2015 ( I think ) I was taking care of a pymt and when asked to verify my address they had an address in a city and state where I have never been in my life. They said they made the correction but just in case I called again and they still had the wrong address. So far now, I think, my address is correct again. I am still waiting for an answer as to how and why this happened. Because of the wrong address, I did not receive a stmt and the reason I had to cancel the autopay to begin with.

04/02/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My husband died two years ago. I have XXXX boys in college. My husband left me with significant financial issues, including outstanding medical bills, debts I was unaware of, a mortgage at a very high interest rate, etc. I began to try and refinance the mortgage over a year ago, with no success, due to my credit report. I tried repairing the credit history and still was not able to refinance. Finally, the mortgage lender NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE , LLC, told me I could be eligible for the mortgage assistance program. They told me to skip one month 's payment in order to show my need. Then, they signed me up for the new loan and told me I had to pay 90 days at a higher rate ( I assumed this was to make up for the payment that was skipped ). At the end of the 90 days, they lowered my interest rate from 8.3 to 7.8 percent - but my monthly payments went from {$2800.00} to {$3200.00} per month, plus accrueing fees of over {$200.00} per month which I ca n't get anyone to explain to me. In addition, Nationstar reported that I was late with those 90 days of payments, when in fact they were not only paid, but they were higher than the original mortgage payments. This then scarred my credit report yet again. Several more attempts have been made to try and refinance so I can get the monthly payment down to something manageable - but my credit report continues to hinder me. Not only has NATIONSTAR made the monthly payments higher through their "" MAP '' program, they have added considerably to the amount of the loan itself. Before I started the MAP program, I owed approximately {$260000.00} on the house. I now owe over $ 270K. How does this happen when I literally begged for months for someone to help me? I do not want this to happen to others. Please help me and help others.

04/04/2015,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"In XX/XX/XXXX, we applied for the mortgage assistance program with Chase Bank, holder of our HELOC. Between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, we exchanged innumerable phone calls with our assigned specialists XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in order to stay on top of the requests for documentation from us to support our application. Often we were contacted to provide duplicate documents because Chase processors misplaced our fax 'd documents. We even filled out the application twice at their request. It was unclear how long the process would take, but we persevered with the constant requests for more information for the underwriters. In XXXX, I went to Chase online to cancel autopay. I had planned to continue online payments, but did not want to participate in autopay. When I did this, I was prevented from using the online payment system at all. No Chase customer service person could explain why. I did not make payment in XXXX. In XXXX, I tried to make the account current by using pay by phone. The customer tech took my credit information to draw the funds and gave me a confirmation number. I noticed that 2 weeks later the draw had not occurred. When I called Chase, I was told that they did not have a correct acct number for the draw. We verified that the account # was accurate. So I authorized another pay by phone transaction in XXXX. Again, I noticed that no draw occurred. NO ONE is Chase customer service could understand or explain why the funds were not drawing ( and yes, I had sufficient funds in my credit union account ), and I assumed that it was because our account was under review for mortgage assistance and perhaps Chase was freezing transactions related to the account. That was my guess, but NO XXXX at Chase had any other explanation. In XXXX I was notified that we were not eligible for relief from the mortgage assistance program. We were told we could enter foreclosure or re-instate the loan by paying account in full by XXXX XXXX. We chose to re-instate the loan with those terms and paid amount due on XX/XX/XXXX. When we tried to make payment in XXXX, we found that we are not eligible to make pay by phone payments because of the problems we experienced in XXXX & XXXX, although we were not at fault for Chase 's failure to draw the funds in those XXXX & XXXX transactions. I do n't understand why a Chase customer was penalized for Chase 's incompetence. Furthermore, and most alarming, is realizing that our credit histories are marked for being 120 days late during ( XXXX ) for the time that Chase was unable to accept our payments. We are also being penalized for the bungling of our attempts to pay the mortgage while our account was under review for mortgage assistance. The marks on our credit histories are very damaging, and will affect our lives significantly. We applied for the mortgage assistance program as Veterans experiencing financial hardship. When we asked for help, we in return received an appalling and "" too big to care '' customer service experience, followed by damaging marks on our credit. Chase had demonstrated extreme incompetence in the handling of our mortgage assistance request and to top it off they are going to slam our credit.

After doing my due diligence, I confirmed nothing had changed with my XXXX account, sufficient funds were readily available, and Chrysler Capital never attempted to withdrawal the XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$420.00} from my account. 
After contacting Chrysler Capital numerous times and being transferred to multiple departments, I received the worst customer service and treatment. I was told it was not their problem, and while they could confirm I did not cancel my auto withdrawal they said "" its possible just by logging into your online Chrysler account you cancelled it '' ( I logged in as soon as I saw the negative judgement on my credit report, and my Chrysler account itself said and still says im set up on auto withdrawal ). Chrysler said they will not take back the negative judgement on my credit report ( my credit score and report have been without any flaws or judgements my entire life ). Now My credit score has this mark, plus has dropped XXXX points as a result. I confirmed through my original lease, CC 's Ts and Cs and their own website that the only way to cancel your auto withdrawal is to send a written confirmation to them, which I never did. I did not want the auto withdrawal to stop ... this was an error on their end that they are penalizing me for.

About 7 weeks into the application process I verified that no other documentation was needed and they confirmed that my loan was clear to close. I then received the final disclosures and then was asked via phone if I wanted to roll over the closing costs since I had enough room to roll that over. I was then transferred to a loan officer and then they started reassessing the loan and then determined that I was no longer approved for the original amount which makes no sense.

This caused my account to accumulate XXXX additional fees than if they had paid the items smallest to largest first. The reasoning the representatives give over the phone is "" we consider the higher dollar items more important in pay order than lower dollar items '' meaning that if they were going to reject payment of an Item they would rather reject payment of the smaller items than the big item. Of course this makes no sense because even after paying the largest item first they still pay the smaller items and still collect extra fees and nothing ever gets rejected on my account because they know with my direct deposit that money coming in is a sure thing. When I asked them to reverse the XXXX unnecessary fees I was told I had already received XXXX complimentary fee reversals for the year so they could not refund the fees. After asking to be escalated twice to a higher person I was told the next person would have to call me back in about two hours. That was approximately 2 days ago and still no call back. So now in addition to not fixing their wrong in the first place they are not calling me back as I was promised. This ACH payment order seems to me an obvious and blatant way to collect more fees from consumers already struggling.

10/20/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I recently inquired with my loan servicer about the steps needed in order to drop my Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ). My servicer explained that I must be at 80 % loan-to-equity value, or my PMI would automatically terminate once I reached 78 % loan-to-equity value. My loan-to-equity value is currently around 83 %, so I explained that I would like to have my property reappraised because I am confident that the new appraisal would result in a loan-to-equity value of at least 80 %. My loan servicer indicated that the only way I could terminate my PMI with a loan-to-equity value of 80 % based on a new appraisal was if I made structural improvements ( e.g., an addition ) to my home. The servicer went on to state that if I wanted my PMI terminated based off of a new appraisal, that my loan-to-equity value would need to be 75 % instead of 80 %. I explained to the representative that I was not told about this at my loan origination, and it was not in any of my closing documents from origination. I requested that the servicer send me documents that I signed during origination indicating that my loan-to-equity value needed to be at 75 % when terminating PMI due to a reappraisal. The servicer sent me the Private Mortgage Insurance Disclosure for a Fixed Rate Mortgage document that I signed at closing, but nowhere in this document does it disclose what the servicer informed me regarding the 75 % loan-to-equity value requirement. The servicer stated that this guideline has been established by XXXX XXXX, whom I contacted thereafter. The representative at XXXX XXXX informed me that 75 % loan-to-equity value is a requirement for reappraisal to terminate PMI if no other structural changes were made to the residence, and the reappraisal took place within the first two years. I again stated that I never acknowledged or signed off on any paperwork at loan origination that disclosed this information to me, the borrower. The representative informed me that he hears stories like this XXXX from borrowers constantly. Since loan origination ( i.e., closing ) is a legally binding agreement between the borrower and the originator, any additional policies in place by the entities who buy the loan should not apply if they were not disclosed in the origination paperwork. To do so is breaking a legally binding agreement between parties of a contract, and should thus be deemed not applicable due to a breach of contract.",Company believes complaint caused principally by actions of third party outside the control or direction of the company,Envoy Mortgage Ltd.,OH,432XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2173208

None of my personal banking reps could explain to me or understand what this fee is. Once I called the phone reps explained it as a fee given when deposited funds are not available and are able to be used. This is not my case however. My account has been charged with a negative balance service charge which then puts my account in the negative .I am charged an overdraft fee and then I am charged again for a negative balance fee for the same occurrence. I have been double charged for the same overrdraft caused by this "" negative balance fee "" and then the cycle happens the very next month for having a negative balance. Ive been charged nearly XXXX $ in the last two months alone. This seems very unfair and I feel taken advantage of especially since my personal banking reps had no clue what a negative balance fee was there for how could I as a customer. I am a seasonal small business this is my XXXX year going into business and I feel Fifth Third Bank is taking advantage of me. If this is not resolved I am shutting down my account immediately and taking my complaint to the highest level possible.

I continue to say that I knew nothing of this until discovering on my credit reports, which I immediately contacted them and have been going back and forth since. I am attaching one of the contacts from my daughter acknowledging it is her debt, XXXX XXXX, not XXXX XXXX. I am asking again for this debt to be removed. If this were my debt, I would have paid and this would be no issue, but to liable for something I had no knowledge is absolutely insane. I am asking Navient to release me of liability immediately and hold XXXX the liable party of the debt. Attached again is a letter from XXXX XXXX.

Opened up new line for phone # 2 through XXXX wireless advocates online. Received phone, phone does not work or preoperly sync with previous XXXX account or XXXX music. Numerous issues with phone as it was not shipped properly ( literally in the factory packaging with no protection for shipping ). Returned phone before 2 weeks was up due to ineffective phone not working properly even to call people. 

Opened up alternate new line in last attempt to receive proper service with a working phone. Went through XXXX XXXX rather than online distributor. Even worse results with iphone not being able to update while contacted to wifi with multiple error codes and account issues and music issues again. Returned phone before 2 week period was up and was tied into contract. 

Tried again with alternative service provider and much better results. Do not want free service, I want a phone that works which could not be accomplished through XXXX and XXXX. 

XXXX reaches out saying you owe us {$78.00}. I call and talk to customer service. XXXX, a female representative, informs me they will call me back after getting manger approval after getting {$20.00} activation fee removed from account for now {$58.00} owed. They never do and I get new notice in the mail. 

New notice now claims {$220.00} is owed on account that has and already is closed. I can not login online to account due to it being closed, but every notice in the mail indicates it is different. 

Receive new letter saying - {$140.00} has been given back to me or accredited to my account. Receive new notice saying it is now {$560.00} both from XXXX and their collections agency XXXX. 

Calls have been made to family members from collection agency demanding to speak with me. XXXX refuses to solve anything with customer service reps and gives me same run around spiel. 

Nothing is getting solved. If I returned both phones and do not use any line with them and canceled the very first line out of my own pocket, why should I have to pay {$560.00} after they just informed me previously that they took {$140.00} off from the {$220.00}? 

None of the numbers are adding up, no XXXX customer rep can help me, and the bill keeps growing even though I do not owe anything for lines that have been canceled.",,"Vantage Sourcing, LLC",AZ,852XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/17/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2117179

08/31/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"In XX/XX/XXXX we took out a HUD XXXX rehabilitation loan. The general contractor came to us before the last draw stating he was over by XXXX or more in "" extras '' as was looking to keep money which was due to the heating subcontractor who 's payment he received on the prior draw but had yet to pay, I notified our lender M & T bank out of XXXX at the time. All work was ceased as we had to go thru arbitration process. M & T had failed to obtain lien waivers prior to any draw requests which did not protect us, the borrower. The general contractor placed a mechanics lien our house for his alleged extras which was dismissed after arbitration in XX/XX/XXXX. The heating sub also placed a lien as well which was valid and paid after arbitration and rightfully so. When is Initially happened, I contacted the White House at who referred me to HUD. I spoke with XXXX XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX from the XXXX office. I told him what transpired and he said it was impossible as the bank requires lien waivers. M & T at the time did not require lien waiver prior to draw disbursement and therefore, did not protect us. Since our issue they have changed their policy and now require a waiver prior to draw release, This is 5 yrs later and we are still financially affected from this due to work we paid for out of pocket that should of be down under the rehab loan, plus attorney fees. Never mind the work still remains which we do not have money for. I have been trying for years to get this point across ... the fact is M & T back did not follow the governments guidlines and policies and procedures but it us the homeowner who still suffering and affected due to this mishandling. Our loan has since been sold to XXXX, but I am seeking acknowledge that M & T bank did not protect us. I will get you more information so you look into this matter. I have tried several offices at Hud, only to get Bounced around. XXXX XXXX XXXX is no longer with HUD XXXX office but he specifically told me that lien waivers should of been obtained. Had they been I would not be writing to you today and till trying to get someone to acknowledge that we were not protected. As a result of all financial issues M & T caused us, we has to go thur a modification process. We won america 's most desperate landscape in XX/XX/XXXX due to the condition he left our front yard and house in. You can see before pictures on line. Again the inside still requires work we have not been able to afford. We have a special needs child who has XXXX and is a XXXX that we were trying to get the house together for. The house is inefficient as work is needed therefore heating is more int the winter. To M & T bank this was corrected, they changed their procedure adding lien waivers protecting them selfs. We are still waiting to be correctedThe address of the property is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
Our account number with M & T bank was XXXX am determined for someone to acknowledge and hold M & T bank accountable. I have written to the White House previously, which is how I cam in contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have tried to get several other HUD agents to look into this matter. I will contact the White House again. Please let me know what you can do for me or who I can turn too. This is not a small matter as it has ruined us financially and emotionally. 
It says you can download attachments, I have and can get all documentation, but not if I send right now, I 'm sure M & T has their case file and all you need to verify is how they did not proctect us but since they require lien waivers when they should of at the time of our loan.

Years later I decided to try school again but this time I enrolled in the online XXXX program at the Art Institute only to find out that the students that had already graduated have no chance at employment with a degree from the Art Institute and that the school was in trouble for the scam they were running. I have since tried to withdraw from the school but their academic counselor treated me horribly for doing so. She also never withdrew me from classes during the first week of the quarter when she was supposed to so now I have to pay for another quarter because she simply wo n't let me withdraw. I 'm currently getting the run around via phone and do n't know what else to do besides continue to try to withdraw and write reviews to warn others about the underhanded tactics of this scam called an Art Institute. I have been ripped off by the Art Institute. They are stealing my student loan money and lying about how much I take out. The tuition and loan amounts dont add up. Something fraudulent is happening here. I have also tried to withdraw and was told that they withdrew me from school but I am still receiving emails from my instructors telling me that its not too late to turn in late assignments so I logged in and saw that I was lied to about being withdrawn so my GPA has tanked and I 'm being charged for classes even after withdrawing. I have talked to other current and former students of the school who are experiencing the exact same thing. This is a scam and needs to be stopped before it ruins more students financial lives. more information can be found at these links. This is another student who experienced the same EXACT thing I am currently going through. They are also switching my financial record around so much that I cant keep track of what I owe for what.

I was in foreclosure, but did not have a sale date. I would call to check the status and for months I was told that the documents were still being reviewed. I then received a letter requesting additional documents by XXXX/XXXX/16, I met the deadline by mailing in the documents before the date on XXXX/XXXX/16. I called to follow up and was told that the documents were not yet received, but not to worry and it was normal. I was nervous, so I resubmitted the documents via email on XXXX/XXXX/16, to the point of contact I was given. When I got through to him to discuss the application, he told me that the documents were not received & that only a limited number of pages could be accepted via fax or email. This was not indicated in the package, where the acceptable methods to submit documents are explained. He told me my review was closed. He said SLS would reopen my review & likely reassign him. In the meantime, he asked that I submit updated documents. I submitted the documents. I then received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/16, indicating that the initial submission was received and requesting additional documents by XXXX/XXXX/16. I know this is confusing, basically SLS said they did not receive documents by XXXX/XXXX/16, however sent me a letter indicating that they did. I was given the wrong information. I was gathering the additional requested documents, again & at the same time just received a Notice of Sale date for XXXX/XXXX/16. I have followed all of the requests by SLS, yet while working on my modification I was given a sale date notice less than a month away. I have a difficult time getting through, I have updated my number several times and they still have the wrong information. I am told different things via mail and on the phone. I am now worried that I am not getting a fair chance at a review, and have incurred more fees associated with the foreclosure.

I never received notice of this while the Plaintiff tried to reach me via server or certified mail during XX/XX/XXXX because I had moved to XXXX that month.

A default judgment was awarded to the plaintiff by the court and I only found out about it in XX/XX/XXXX when I received notice I would be garnished in the amount of 25 % of my wages. I contested the garnishment on the basis I was not notified and this was not my debt. On XX/XX/XXXX the judge denied my appeal and the garnishment has continued. I contend that this debt is not mine and I have asked the current attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX for proper proof that this is my debt. He stated he would have to take some time to do so. In the mean time I have received another letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, on behalf of LVNV, for {$3300.00} for another debt that is not mine. I am in the process of asking for proof of this debt. The only negative marks on my credit report are from LVNV and XXXX XXXX, another collection agency related to LVNV. I believe that LVNV is fraudently garnishing my wages and attempting to collect more through illegal and immoral practices. Their license was taken away in Maryland a few years ago and ordered to pay restitution of over {$10.00} XXXX to people they had collected funds from in which they had no right to do so. I am looking for a stop of all collection attempts and garnishments. While the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have followed the law in denying my request for appeal, I believe that this debt must be proven to be mine by the collector before being able to do so. If in criminal court a person is innocent until proven guilty then should n't this also hold true for civil cases? By the way, the only paperwork given to the court by the original attorneys in this case is a blank credit card agreement with no name, social security number, account number, amount, or signature. How can this be used to show that I owe anything to this company?

10/30/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Its with my mortgage with Wells Fargo, for the last year i have been trying to work with wells Fargo. I had situations i expressed to them with my mortgage. they put with a XXXX XXXX Home Preservation Department. I explained to her the house needed alot of work i wanted to straighten things out with my behind mortgage payments and what options. she suggest to do a modification. i to ; d her that not what i was looking to do for 1 i had one already while back and i told her from what i understand you cant have 2. at any event all i wanted Wells Fargo to do iam not looking for them to wave any payments at that time, but just put the past do payments on the back of the loan and will get right on track. XXXX said we do n't do deferments. I asked her why she said because people usually dont keep there agreement. Well i told her that makes no sense at all because you can do all that work for a modification and that 's why they put you on a ninety day probation period in case you dont keep your payment agreement. At least what i was asking to do did n't change the price or payment of the loan and does not forgive any money owed. Now what would take less work and make more sense for a bank for there investment. I would say Deferment.. So at this i told XXXX who was pushing me on the modification that i do n't want to do this and drag on and fall further behind if this does go through. She assured me that there would be other payment option and she would work with me not to worry. Well i gave her everything she asked for this dragged on and on she was asking for documents i have already sent her. at this point i was n't really happy with her did n't feel she really knows whats going on or she really didn, t .care. Well finally XXXX called me back after a few months with a smirk ish and disrespectful attitude to tell me i was denied and i would be getting a letter in the mail. I asked her about my other paynent options or other options as she said there would be if denied. She whith a rude attitude and said there are none. Again replied i would be getting a letter. at this point i wanted to speak to someone else. No one at wells Fargo would give anyone else to speak with. XXXX at this point was not returning any of my calls. finally i recieved the letter. well there was a mistake i caught XXXX maid processing my paper work so i called and left her a message at her private phone line at XXXX extension XXXX. never recieved a response. so i filled out the appeal form and sent it back to there designated fax line with the reason and that they have the documents to get with me and i will go over with it with them. She sent a letter that pretty much said i said i do n't have the documents so the answered is still no with any hesitation whats so ever. she never called me back to go over or explain where they made the mistake i had the documents and so did she they were in the package. i also sent it and wrote it with my appeal. She lied saying she called me back to other employees. and still i could not speak with anyone else in reference to my mortgage, Now out of how many thousands of employees work at wells Fargo you mean to tell me there 's no one other than this XXXX XXXX to respond or handle loan situations for mortgage. No matter who i talked to after the fact and told them when they referring me back to this XXXX XXXX was handling my loan. And no matter how many times i told the other party i did not want to deal with her to please give some else who can help me. i Was told there is no one else. So here i am trying to make good of my situation now that has only fallen further behind because iam not going to just assume and make my own deal. loosing all i have worked hard for. I am not dealing with non return of phone calls i have sent qualified written request rescission letter omb # XXXX

I mentioned the website said the word "" recurring '', the person on the phone said that they do not even have my checking account information on file. 

On XXXX I noticed that my checking account was lower then usual. So I did some digging and found out that on XXXX and XXXX Gatewayone had stolen amounts equal to my auto loan payment from my checking account. I called Gatewayone lending and asked about my recurring payment, they told me again I do not have XXXX and that they see in their system that I called in XX/XX/XXXX. Their system had notes about me wanting to cancel my recurring payment, and their notes said I did not have recurring payment setup. I informed the agent on the phone that I would like to know why my checking account shows they have been taking money from me then. They put me on a hold and came back saying they were sorry and would like proof they took my money. I told them I want the money back in my account in the same time frame it took them to steal it from me ( payment was due on the XXXX, they had the money out of my account by the XXXX, so XXXX days ). They told me that was not possible and that they require I provide a copy of my bank statement to prove they stole from me ( even though the person on the phone admitted that they see the amounts posted on my loan ). I informed the representive that I have been recording them ( they have an automatic message that says I may be recorded, so turn about is fair play ), they were fine with the recording. 

I contacted my bank to put a stop payment on all the fraud done by Gatewayone lending.

11/18/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"four months ago I sent a debt validation letter to Carrington Mortgage service, disputing my alleged debt, and asking them to prove ownership of the note. they replied with "" copies '' of a note signed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and declared they own it now. I sent another letter stating that copies of an alleged note do not apply under the XXXX and wanted them to show me the actual physical note in order to prove their claim of ownership, as so far their word that they do, does not serve as proof of ownership. They sent my second letter back accompanied by their own letter stating they did not know what I was asking for, so they were placing my claim as invalid. During this time I did not pay them anything they said I owed because of their failure to verify. According to notices I was receiving and my credit report, they continued to keep my "" account '' active and continued to accumulate late payments. I sought to resolve this in court, I personally prepared a case using laws in the FDCPA and the XXXX, and took it to my local court house. I was turned away by the clerks saying they would not file a lawsuit unless I had a lawyer. So I began calling lawyers. The lawyers who had any knowledge of the FDCPA or the XXXX or even mortgages told me they would n't do anything until I paid a retainer and hourly fees, which I can not afford. I finally got ahold of a lawyer through the Volunteer lawyers network, and he advised me to petition the Minnesota attorney general with my complaint, which I did. My response from them was to contact the CFPB, because Minnesota judges were split on how to proceed with cases of this nature, and the CFPB was a federal body which could help. I did n't know what to do at the time because Carrington Mortgage Services was still considering my requests invalid and threatening to foreclose on my home, and time was ticking by. So I resolved myself to throw in the towel and call Carrington to try and work something out. I called them and went through an information process to try working out a repayment plan for the alleged debt and my delinquency thereof. They told me I did n't make enough money to do a repayment so I had to catch it all up before they would work with me. It took me a month to save and borrow enough money to cover what they said I was delinquent by, and I called them with bank info in hand in order to pay it. They refused to take my payment due to my "" foreclosure status. '' I told them I had no idea I was officially in foreclosure and I have the money to pay. They said it did n't matter and they had to request a "" reinstatement amount. '' I asked how long that would take, and this call being made on a Friday Morning they said they would get it to me by email as soon as they got it. The following Monday I received a letter from a lawyer representing them, and a letter from them as well, XXXX stating I am officially in Foreclosure. I called them same day and they still did n't have the reinstatement, I called them on Tuesday, still no statement. I ended up getting ahold of the CFPB by phone who transferred me to a mortgage councilor. Together we called Carrington and got the same result. In an attempt to wrap this up before I run out of characters, my complaints can be summed up as. 1. they claim to own an invalidated debt due to their noncompliance and willful dissent of my requests. 2. while in dispute they are allowing the "" late payments '' to accumulate in order to exact a foreclosure. 3. My credit report still reflects payments are current in lieu of their claim I am in foreclosure. 4. Due to this lack of compliance, due diligence, and proper communication they are trying to collect extra late fees and lawyer costs of this entire process. None of my understanding of the law or morality says any of this is right. I have dates, documents, and legal evidences supporting all of my claims.

10/27/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"This is my second complaint against Select Portfolio Servicing. 
Complaint : Since XXXX we have been applying for a loan modification from SPS. We have submitted hundreds of requested documents, answered numerous phone calls, and paid for legal representation XXXX times, but to date we have not received any loan modification offer. 
We submitted requested documents as late as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, only to be told by the SPS representative that our loan will be transferred to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This whole situation has been nothing but excruciating for us. We have seen this change of servicer as a pattern that began with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and SPS with no resolution in sight. What is most frustrating is that we know that we fully qualify and meet the requirements for the government 's loan modification programs and yet we have been denied by SPS and prior servicers. Therefore, our conclusion is that our loan is being subjected to additional requirements other than those of the government 's by SPS and prior servicers We believe that : 1. The continuing practice of servicers repeatedly requesting documents from homeowners are doing so to purposefully increase our indebtedness for the company 's financial gain and this should be investigated for illegal actions. 
2. SPS is using their in-house policies and requirements for our loan modification, and not those of the government 's programs for financial gain.. 
3. Discrimination could be a factor in repeatedly denying us a loan modification. This is based on our ethnicity ( XXXX ), age ( XXXX ), and our family structure ( not husband and wife, but parents and adult children ). 
3. SPS is continuing to purposefully use delay tactics to deny us a loan modification so that our delinquency indebtedness continues to increase. This conclusion is based on their evaluation policies, repeated requests for the same documents, and general threats about legal action against us. We also believe that information about our mortgage loan status is shared with investors who routinely stop in front of our home and either look until we come out front or come to our door with questions. Recently, we had a visit from a private investigator that was sent to verify who is residing in our home. 

Background : XXXX XXXX ( son ) is principal on the loan XXXX XXXX ( mother ) is secondary of the loan We have proven we can pay for a reasonable loan modification. In XXXX my son, who is principal on the loan, filed for bankruptcy in accordance with a Florida program for obtaining a loan modification. Through bankruptcy court we paid SPS {$30000.00} @ {$1400.00} per month until XXXX XXXX when the application was denied on the grounds of insufficient income. This was a wrongful denial because SPS disregarded our attorney 's repeated submission of collective income from our family. SPS chose to use XXXX income only for evaluation. Our attorney filed a dispute for the denial but was unsuccessful in getting it overturned. 
Our financial hardship began in XXXX, XXXX when we refinanced our loan with XXXX XXXX. Six months later we were sued because XXXX XXXX fraudulently forged the signatures of the prior owners to process our loan. Due to this we incurred significant expenses for attorney 's fees. Making home repairs and maintenance on our home then and now continues to be on a cash basis. Our mortgage is an upside down loan - {$330000.00} according to SPS billing, and the latest actual value is {$260000.00}. Even obtaining home owners insurance has been unsuccessful due to the status of our loan.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc",FL,336XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/27/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2181986

09/16/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I along with my Realtor have been working with Green Tree Sercicing LLC ( "" Green Tree '' ). now Ditech Financial LLC effective XXXX XXXX 2015. My house located at XXXX XXXX XXXX has been on the market several months, we requested and was granted permission to conduct a short sale. My Realtor presented seveal offers to Green Tree but they refused each saying they did not provide the level of funds they desired. My Realtor discussed options with me and I decided to pursue the Deed in lui of Sale if the final offer was refused by Green Tree. My Realtor conveyed this to the Green Tree representative, who did her best to support us. We then received word that Green Tree would pursue foreclousure procedings on XXXX XXXX and a decision was needed atleast 30 days prior to allow for the deed in lui of sale to be processed. My Realtor attempted several times to contact Green Tree to advise them of the decision to pursue the dead in lieu of sale but could not contact anyone ; she final got through on XXXX XXXX, XXXX day after XXXX ) and was told it was now to late to request a deed in lieu since it was inside the 30 day window. I spoke with the Green Tree representative and requested they reconsider since attempts were made to contact them prior to XXXX XXXX and they were closed on XXXX XXXX for the holiday. 
It is unreasonable that Green Tree would refuse to accept my request for a Deed in Lui with the rational that it was XXXX date late given the prevailing circumstance. I have made every effort to resolve this mortgage issue, I informed Green Tree that my hands have been tied and mitigation processes were not an option since I have a court order mandating the house been put on the market and any proceeds shared with my former spouse. I continued making payments on the house and maintaned the insurance even though I would not recoup any profits from its sale. I explained to Green Tree it did not make sense to foreclose on the property and they reap pennies on the dollar versus accepting the offers submitted or now the deed in lieu of sale. The Green Tree representative told me her hands were tied and the final decision rest with her leadership. I am sending a letter/email to her leadership asking them to reconsider but also need the foreclousure process to be pushed back to allow time for us to reconsider the options and come to some common level of understanding and agreement on the way forward. 
I am currently vigorously involved in yearend closeout with the United States XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, North Carolina and have scarce amounts of available time to make personal phone calls regarding this matter. I need the foreclosure proceeding pushed back to allow me and my Realtor to work out reasonable options with the Green Tree/Ditech representatives.

The referee said that we should include in the modification request, proof of how much additional income we will be getting with my husband 's pension and with my social security, which we did.

02/10/2016,Credit reporting,,Improper use of my credit report,Report improperly shared by CRC,"XXXX XXXX, 2016 I initiated an online dispute regarding the inaccurate reporting of inquiries and previous addresses on my Equifax file. Prior to that, I sent in a letter disputing inquiry information contained on my Equifax Credit Report. I received a notification back when the investigation was completed ( in one day - hardly a thorough investigation ), with my addresses getting deleted but contained a canned response regarding Equifax 's policy on inquiries. 
In their explanation they stated inquiries are factual record of file access. Are other accounts listed on one 's report considered factual reporting of account usage? I would assume and hope so. My Equifax report has contained both adverse and positive account ratings from accounts that were not mine over the years. Could it not be assumed that inquiries can be attributed to one 's credit report belonging to an account that is not their account in the first place? I would think so. If they can misplace and misreport accounts, I believe you could do the same with inquiries. 
Let me remind you that as a Credit Reporting Agency, Equifax is bounded in the terms set forth in the FCRA. Also let me remind you that under section 611 of the FCRA that you are required to investigate the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file, not just items that Equifax deems fit to investigate. This includes Names, Addresses, Account Numbers, Account Balances, and INQUIRIES. Being that inquiries can have an effect on the FICO statistical model and XXXX score, you are even more obligated to investigate inquiries. Inquiries pose adverse results in consumer scoring by lower scores and extension of credit by grantors who sometimes deem too many inquiries within a certain amount of hypothetical time 'adverse ' and as a reason for denial. 
Again let me remind you 611 of the FCRA : 1 ) 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ] ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information. 
( 1 ) Reinvestigation required. 
( A ) In general. If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly of such dispute, the agency shall reinvestigate free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer. 
If I have reason to believe that an inquiry was unauthorized I contact the credit-reporting agency, not the creditor. It is not up to me to investigate items on my credit report. Equifax is responsible by choice of being in business as a Credit Reporting Agency to maintain complete and accurate credit files on consumers for its subscribers. 
Let me also make Equifax aware that if they are claiming "" inquiries are factual record of file access '' then they have not only set up the subscribers for lawsuits for a {$1000.00} per non-permissible inquiry but also enable a suit to filed against Equifax employees for {$5000.00} and/or imprisonment for per non-permissible inquiry. ( 620. Unauthorized disclosures by officers or employees [ 15 U.S.C. 1681r ] Any officer or employee of a consumer reporting agency who knowingly and willfully provides information concerning an individual from the agency 's files to a person not authorized to receive that information shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. ) I suggest Equifax takes this formal complaint of negligent investigative practices seriously.

For six years I have hired XXXX lawyers and filed XXXX Dodd-Frank Modifications packages. I have spent over {$9000.00} in legal fees. My interest rate on the mortgage is at 8.875 %. Green Tree Mortgage Services acquired the note in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and offerred another loan modification package. This was done. Unfortunately, they chose a "" Bait and Switch '' approach. Green Tree did not modify the interest. Now the interest amount totals well over {$170000.00} +/- plus the principal of {$200000.00}. Green Tree offerred a 4.125 % on the pricipal, but chose not to modify the interest amount. The house is under water and not worth the mortgage amount of XXXX. The town as a value of {$190000.00}. 
Before XXXX sold the note to Green Tree, representatives broke into the house and winterized the house without my consent. Also, XXXX representatives told tenants who were living there not to pay the rent. Nearly {$11000.00} was lost. 
It is my belief that XXXX and Green Tree do not want to modify the principal nor the interest amount. XXXX has acquired a judicial sale date, but I met the three month trail period.

03/19/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"This report is not the first filed, but it is the one that included communication with both Equifax and the bankruptcy court itself. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a request w/bank. Court to request Ch XXXX court fees be waived IF my husband and I decided to file bankruptcy due to the fact I had been laid off and was worried we would be late on mortgage on my homestead home. I had to file pro se due to financial problems. Clerk required me to fill out info regarding my husband and I in general, but no creditor info. I had no idea the form implied I was filing Ch XXXX for my husband and I. 
The request was granted to waive court costs, but I found I would get Unemployment for the layoff, so we decided not to seek protection from the Court. In addition, XXXX had removed my name from my homestead home mortgage and refused to put it back on, so I did n't think I would be able to get protection anyway, even though the home was my HOMESTEAD HOME for 8 yrs total and I never had one late payment on it ( filing separate complaint ). 
Bankruptcy was ruled as "" dismissed '' due to "" other reasons '' as we did not respond to supplying ANY creditors or file any first notices. Neither my husband nor I even knew that we had bankruptcies listed on our reports until years later, at which point I began disputing them. 
The court listed XXXX bankruptcies on each of our reports only 15 days apart with XXXX separate case numbers both "" dismissed ''. The credit reports listed XXXX and XXXX as the bankruptcy file numbers, a phone number that was no longer in service as the contact, and repeatedly said they verified the information with the Court through that number and that both were valid and refused to remove. 
I sent a letter to the bankruptcy court to dispute after calling several times and being told by the Trustee that it "" was n't their problem ''. I received no response. I hired XXXX XXXX and currently XXXX to have these removed to no avail. 
These XXXX bankruptcies have been listed on both mine and my husband 's reports for over 7 years and have severely affected our credit and ability to get credit and they STILL refuse to remove either bankruptcy. We have n't been able to afford a lawyer and have n't been able to find any guidance on how to have them removed. In researching I found it is too late to appeal and I do n't know how to file a motion to vacate and I ca n't afford a lawyer. I feel the Court should have removed these the first time I disputed them XX/XX/XXXX when I first learned about them and disputed them, and that they should have ensured they were both removed from all three bureaus from both our reports. I NEED them removed now. We have paid for my mistake for long enough and the law states that if there is no evidence of unethical intent or attempt to defraud a creditor or delay a payment, the dismissal should be vacated or reversed. 
I have all supporting documentation regarding the facts above and will be happy to share it. Please email XXXXXXXXXXXX or call XXXX. 
Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in this matter.

Not only was I NEVER able to reach a live person on the phone ( after two 25+ minute hold times ), I sent the below email to them only to have them respond to me that they no longer accept such emails and directed me back to their Online chat, or call center. They are the worst ( though they 're likely in good company with other massive banks ). 

Dear Bank of America/client retention : You have your work cut out for you today. I 've had enough. Enough of your poorly facilitated transactions, poorer customer service, and lack of any kind of reliable feedback. I 've been a BOA client for over 10 years, with checking, savings, credit card, and business accounts, however you 've done NOTHING to keep my business, and now I know that the final straw has been dropped. 

Today you double-debited my checking account for my rent check, overdrawing my account by {$1500.00}. When I called to rectify, I was on hold for over TWENTY minutes ( 23 minutes before I had to move on with my life, and hung up ). Concurrently, I attempted to use your chat service- for the first 10 minutes, NO AGENTS were available. Then, I was told it would be a 6 minute wait. SIX minutes- to clear up your error. Keep in mind, I 'm still on hold on the phone during this entire time. 

Next, I tried to send an email- to my surprise ( though perhaps I should n't be surprised given your pattern and trend of sub-par service ) the only "" options '' I was given to send an email re : checking are : order a check copy, order a statement copy, or "" financial hardship. '' Are those really the ONLY things you think your customers might need to email you about?? 

Enough. By my own sweat and efforts ( as you 're clearly not accessible to help ) I 'm going to clear up your error regarding my checking account. I will next be opening new accounts with my local bank. My direct deposits, cash, and all other immediate banking will be going elsewhere because, frankly, you 're too big to care. Shame on you for being a glutton. Shame on you for becoming the target and symbol of what this country now despises. I should have seen this coming, of course ; I 'm just too smart to be banking with BOA.

10/15/2016,Debt collection,Payday loan,Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"Had taken out a loan with Spotloan XX/XX/2016. I stopped paying on the loan because I no longer could afford the payments. After consulting with an attorney, she suggested that I file a complaint against this company for violations of the FDCPA and Rosenthal FDCPA as she determined that this company along with his prior collection companies, engage in serious collection violations which has caused me and my family a great deal of distress. The individuals representing this company bullied and intimated me as well as called me on numerous occasions threatening legal action, wage garnishment, etc. if I did not pay this debt and refused my requests to contact my family members, called me a "" deadbeat '' and other defamatory comments and threatened to continue to call my family members despite my request until I paid the debt. I also received multiple calls from their "" process server '' who called me as well as my family members threatening to serve me with papers even though no law suit was currently pending. The collectors left messages with a case number which did not exist in the court system according to my attorney. In addition, my family members were repeatedly called by this company even though they knew how and where to reach me. The distress over the repeated contacts, threats and harassment to me and my family coerced me into making a {$200.00} payment last month that I could not afford. This whole incident finally led me to contact an attorney to represent me in this matter and who also directed me to file a complaint with the FTC as it is her opinion that this company engaged in borderline criminal and unlawful debt collection tactics. I 'm filing this complaint in the hopes that this company can be stopped and put out of business so as to not put any other people in the situation that they put me through.",Company believes complaint caused principally by actions of third party outside the control or direction of the company,BlueChip Financial,CA,913XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/15/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2162362

04/22/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"I had 2 payments left on my car loan XX/XX/XXXX. I was trying to close my bank account that my automatic payments had been made from for the last 58 months so it had {$0.00} in it. I called Fifth Third Bank ( 53Bank ) to pay off the remainder of my loan over the phone before my automatic payment was made. The loan officer I spoke to me assured me this was possible, took my new account info, and processed the payment. 

The next day I saw that she had sent the full payment to my closed account so I received an overdraft fee and my own bank 's ( XXXX ) fee. Then, per 53Bank procedure ( which I 'm not sure I ever agreeded to ), my automatic payment went through the same day so I got XXXX more fees ( XXXX from 53Bank and XXXX from my bank ). Again, per 53Bank procedure, they automatically tried my account again for the monthly loan amount and I received XXXX more fees. 

I called 53Bank again and they told me that loan payoffs can only be made by check ( the original rep said nothing about this ). At this point I elevated my claim to a supervisor who yelled at me and when I elevated the claim above her I got a voicemail. I left a message and never received a call back. 

At this point I tweeted at the bank and CFPB. The next day a resolution officer - XXXX - reached out on XXXX and we setup a call. He was able to tell me how to pay off my loan and give me his direct line if I had any questions. 

I mail in a check to the address the claims rep gave me but since I have had automatic payments setup since day 1 of my loan I never knew my account number or had access to my loan "" coupons '' that would normally accompany a mailed payment so my check did n't have my account number on it to make it easy for 53Bank 's system and did n't realize this until yesterday. 

I call XXXX each week I do n't see my check cleared and he never picks up. I leave a message which is never returned. 

Now, my original payment is about to be 30 day past due and my check still has n't been cashed. So I call customer service. They go into their system to look at every check received since XX/XX/XXXX but do n't find a check of my amount. So they never received my check they help me get setup on the website, try to make a payment, any payment, and the site throws an error to call customer service who I 'm already talking to. So they transfer me to a supervisor who says they ca n't process it because it 's past due so I 'm transferred to claims. They are n't able to process it because of an unknown reason so they transfer me back to customer service. By now I 've been transferred so many times that the call quality is terrible so the lady I end up talking to thinks the line is dead and hangs up. I call again. Again, CS to Claims, to CS then CS supervisor - XXXX. 2 hours later the supervisor talks to IT who says there 's an unknown technical issue preventing any department from taking my payment. I ask XXXX if there is anyway he can send me documentation to prove that 53Bank 's systems are the reason that my payment still ca n't be processed. XXXX says he 's unable to make outside emails nor am I allowed to make a recording of his comments ( 2-party consent and all that ). I also asked every person I spoke to on the phone if they could see all the calls I 've made in the last month or so and they ca n't. There 's no way for the operators to follow my history with this issue.
